1.6.0 (2020-07-01)

1.5.0 (2015-01-14)
    - Many fixes.
    - Python 3 support.

    WARNING! Backwards-incompatible change! In the post, the order of the pural forms that android2po expected in .po files was somewhat unspecified. Now, the order [zero, one, two, few, many, other] is used.

1.2.0 (2012-03-18)
    - Support for plurals.
    - Existing languages are now determined based on gettext catalogs,
      this makes it possible to not put the values-xx/ directories under
      source control.
    - The --template option may now contain placeholders similar to those
      --layout supports.
    - Properly import messages that start with an '@' character. As a
      result, string resources that use the @-reference syntax are no
      longer exported at all.
    - Strings marked translatable=false are now ignored (by Kenny Root).
    - Comments in resource files are now processed and included in the
      gettext catalogs (by Kenny Root).
    - Format strings are now properly flagged; this can be used for
      validation of the translated string (by Kenny Root).
    - Better handling of arrays, correctly deal with long arrays.
    - A variety of other small improvements and bug fixes.

1.1.0 (2010-04-07)
    - Fixed edge cases in which non-significant newlines/tabs could
      end up in the .po file.
    - Added support for string-array.
    - New "init" command, which expands on "export --initial", and
      can also be used to initialize arbitrary new languages.
    - Support for configuration files, and a whole slew of nice
      options, like the ability to ignore messages.
    - Nicer output.
    - Decent test coverage, we're getting there.

1.0.1 (2009-12-04)
    - The ``a2po`` script installed when only distutils is available
      was broken.
    - Minor doc fixes.

1.0.0
    Initial release.
