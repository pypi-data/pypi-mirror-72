# API reference

In general, using `help(symbol)` is the recommended way to get the latest documentation. In addition, this page provides an overview of the various elements in this package.


## 1 - On case functions side

### `CaseData` type hint

A proposed standard type hint for the case functions outputs. `CaseData = Tuple[Given, ExpectedNormal, ExpectedError]` where 

```python
Given = Any
"""The input(s) for the test. It can be anything"""

ExpectedNormal = Optional[Any]
"""The expected test results in case success is expected, or None if this test
 should fail"""

ExpectedError = Optional[Union[Type[Exception], 
                               Exception, 
                               Callable[[Exception], Optional[bool]]]]
"""The expected error in case failure is expected, or None if the test should 
succeed. It is proposed that expected error can be defined as an exception 
type, an exception instance, or an exception validation function"""
```

### `@case_name`

`@case_name(name: str)`

Decorator to override the name of a case function. The new name will be used instead of the function name, in test names.

```python
@case_name('simple_case')
def case_simple():
    ...
```

### `@case_tags`

`@case_tags(*tags: Any)`

Decorator to tag a case function with a list of tags. These tags can then be used in the `@cases_data` test function decorator to filter cases within the selected module(s).

**Parameters:**

 - `tags`: a list of tags that may be used to filter the case. Tags can be anything (string, objects, types, functions...)


### `@test_target`

`@test_target(target: Any)`

A simple decorator to declare that a case function is associated with a particular target.

```python
@test_target(int)
def case_to_test_int():
    ...
```

This is actually an alias for `@case_tags(target)`, that some users may find a bit more readable.


### `@cases_generator`

`@cases_generator(name_template: str, lru_cache: bool=False, **param_ranges)`

Decorator to declare a case function as being a cases generator. `param_ranges`  should be a named list of parameter ranges to explore to generate the cases.
    
The decorator will use `itertools.product` to create a cartesian product of the named parameter ranges, and create a case for each combination. When the case function will be called for a given combination, the corresponding parameters will be passed to the decorated function.

```python
@cases_generator("test with i={i}", i=range(10))
def case_10_times(i):
    ''' Generates 10 cases '''
    ins = dict(a=i, b=i+1)
    outs = i+1, i+2
    return ins, outs, None
```

**Parameters:**

 - `name_template`: a name template, that will be transformed into the case name using `name_template.format(**params)` for each case, where params is the dictionary of parameter values for this generated case.
 - `lru_cache`: a boolean (default False) indicating if the generated cases should be cached. This is identical to decorating the function with an additional `@lru_cache(maxsize=n)` where n is the total number of generated cases.
 - `param_ranges`: named parameters and for each of them the list of values to be used to generate cases. For each combination of values (a cartesian product is made) the parameters will be passed to the underlying function so they should have names the underlying function can handle. 


### `MultipleStepsCaseData` type hint

You may wish to use this type hint instead of `CaseData` when your case functions may return dictionaries of given/expected_normal/expected_error.

`MultipleStepsCaseData = Tuple[Union[Given, Dict[Any, Given]],
                               Union[ExpectedNormal, Dict[Any, ExpectedNormal]],
                               Union[ExpectedError, Dict[Any, ExpectedError]]]`

## 2 - On test functions side

### `@cases_fixture`

`@cases_fixture(cases=None, module=None, case_data_argname='case_data', has_tag=None, filter=None)`

Decorates a function so that it becomes a parametrized fixture.

The fixture will be automatically parametrized with all cases listed in module `module`, or with
all cases listed explicitly in `cases`.

Using it with a non-None `module` argument is equivalent to
 * extracting all cases from `module`
 * then decorating your function with @pytest.fixture(params=cases) with all the cases

So

```python
from pytest_cases import cases_fixture, CaseData

# import the module containing the test cases
import test_foo_cases

@cases_fixture(module=test_foo_cases)
def foo_fixture(case_data: CaseData):
    ...
```

is equivalent to:

```python
import pytest
from pytest_cases import get_all_cases, get_pytest_parametrize_args

# import the module containing the test cases
import test_foo_cases

# manually list the available cases
cases = get_all_cases(module=test_foo_cases)

# transform into required arguments for pytest (applying the pytest marks if needed)
marked_cases, cases_ids = get_pytest_parametrize_args(cases)

# parametrize the fixture manually
@pytest.fixture(params=marked_cases, ids=cases_ids)
def foo_fixture(request):
    case_data = request.param  # type: CaseData
    ...
```

**Parameters**

 - `case_data_argname`: the optional name of the function parameter that should receive the `CaseDataGetter` object. Default is `case_data`.
 - Other parameters (cases, module, has_tag, filter) can be used to perform explicit listing, or filtering, of cases to include. See `get_all_cases()` for details about them.

### `@cases_data`

`@cases_data(cases=None, module=None, case_data_argname='case_data', has_tag=None, filter=None)`

Decorates a test function so as to automatically parametrize it with all cases listed in module `module`, or with all cases listed explicitly in `cases`.

Using it with a non-None `module` argument is equivalent to

 * extracting all cases from `module`
 * then decorating your function with `@pytest.mark.parametrize` with all the cases

So

```python
from pytest_cases import cases_data

# import the module containing the test cases
import test_foo_cases

@cases_data(module=test_foo_cases)
def test_foo(case_data):
    ...
```
 
is equivalent to:

```python
import pytest
from pytest_cases import get_all_cases, get_pytest_parametrize_args

# import the module containing the test cases
import test_foo_cases

# manually list the available cases
cases = get_all_cases(module=test_foo_cases)

# transform into required arguments for pytest (applying the pytest marks if needed)
marked_cases, cases_ids = get_pytest_parametrize_args(cases)

# parametrize the test function manually
@pytest.mark.parametrize('case_data', marked_cases, ids=str)
def test_foo(case_data):
    ...
```

**Parameters**

 - `case_data_argname`: the optional name of the function parameter that should receive the `CaseDataGetter` object. Default is `case_data`.
 - Other parameters (cases, module, has_tag, filter) can be used to perform explicit listing, or filtering, of cases to include. See `get_all_cases()` for details about them.

### `CaseDataGetter`

A proxy for a test case. Instances of this class are created by `@cases_data` or `get_all_cases`. It provides a single method:

`get(self, *args, **kwargs) -> Union[CaseData, Any]`

This method calls the actual underlying case function with arguments propagation, and returns the result. The case functions can use the proposed standard `CaseData` type hint and return outputs matching this type hint, but this is not mandatory.

### `unfold_expected_err`

'Unfolds' the expected error `expected_e` to return a tuple of

 - expected error type
 - expected error instance
 - error validation callable

If `expected_e` is an exception type, returns `expected_e, None, None`.
If `expected_e` is an exception instance, returns `type(expected_e), expected_e, None`.
If `expected_e` is an exception validation function, returns `Exception, None, expected_e`.

**Parameters:**

 - `expected_e`: an `ExpectedError`, that is, either an exception type, an exception instance, or an exception validation function


### `get_all_cases`

`get_all_cases(cases=None, module=None, this_module_object=None, has_tag=None, filter=None) -> List[CaseDataGetter]`

Lists all desired cases for a given user query. This function may be convenient for debugging purposes.
    

**Parameters:**

 - `cases`: a single case or a hardcoded list of cases to use. Only one of `cases` and `module` should be set.
 - `module`: a module or a hardcoded list of modules to use. You may use `THIS_MODULE` to indicate that the module is the current one. Only one of `cases` and `module` should be set.
 - `this_module_object`: any variable defined in the module of interest, for example a function. It is used to find "this module", when `module` contains `THIS_MODULE`. 
 - `has_tag`: an optional tag used to filter the cases in the `module`. Only cases with the given tag will be selected.
 - `filter`: an optional filtering function taking as an input a list of tags associated with a case, and returning a boolean indicating if the case should be selected. It will be used to filter the cases in the `module`. It both `has_tag` and `filter` are set, both will be applied in sequence.


## 3 - Pytest goodies

### `@fixture_plus`

```python
fixture_plus(scope="function", autouse=False, name=None, 
             unpack_into=None, hook=None, **kwargs)
```

Identical to `@pytest.fixture` decorator, except that 

 - it supports multi-parametrization with `@pytest.mark.parametrize` as requested in [pytest#3960](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3960). As a consequence it does not support the `params` and `ids` arguments anymore.
 
 - it supports a new argument `unpack_into` where you can provide names for fixtures where to unpack this fixture into.

As a consequence it does not support the `params` and `ids` arguments anymore.

**Parameters:**

 - **scope**: the scope for which this fixture is shared, one of "function" (default), "class", "module" or "session".
 - **autouse**: if True, the fixture func is activated for all tests that can see it.  If False (the default) then an explicitreference is needed to activate the fixture.
 - **name**: the name of the fixture. This defaults to the name of the decorated function. Note: If a fixture is used in the same module in which it is defined, the function name of the fixture will be shadowed by the function arg that requests the fixture; one wayto resolve this is to name the decorated function ``fixture_<fixturename>`` and then use ``@pytest.fixture(name='<fixturename>')``.
 - **unpack_into**: an optional iterable of names, or string containing coma-separated names, for additional fixtures to create to represent parts of this fixture. See `unpack_fixture` for details.
 - **hook**: an optional hook to apply to each fixture function that is created during this call. The hook function will be called everytime a fixture is about to be created. It will receive a single argument (the function implementing the fixture) and should return the function to use. For example you can use `saved_fixture` from `pytest-harvest` as a hook in order to save all such created fixtures in the fixture store.
 - **kwargs**: other keyword arguments for `@pytest.fixture`

### `unpack_fixture`

`unpack_fixture(argnames, fixture, hook=None) -> Tuple[<Fixture>]`

Creates several fixtures with names `argnames` from the source `fixture`. Created fixtures will correspond to elements unpacked from `fixture` in order. For example if `fixture` is a tuple of length 2, `argnames="a,b"` will create two fixtures containing the first and second element respectively.

The created fixtures are automatically registered into the callers' module, but you may wish to assign them to variables for convenience. In that case make sure that you use the same names, e.g. `a, b = unpack_fixture('a,b', 'c')`.

**Parameters**

 - **argnames**: same as `@pytest.mark.parametrize` `argnames`.
 - **fixture**: a fixture name string or a fixture symbol. If a fixture symbol is provided, the created fixtures will have the same scope. If a name is provided, they will have scope='function'. Note that in practice the performance loss resulting from using `function` rather than a higher scope is negligible since the created fixtures' body is a one-liner.
 - **hook**: an optional hook to apply to each fixture function that is created during this call. The hook function will be called everytime a fixture is about to be created. It will receive a single argument (the function implementing the fixture) and should return the function to use. For example you can use `saved_fixture` from `pytest-harvest` as a hook in order to save all such created fixtures in the fixture store.

**Outputs:** the created fixtures.

### `fixture_union`

```python
fixture_union(name, fixtures, 
              scope="function", idstyle='explicit', ids=fixture_alternative_to_str, 
              unpack_into=None, autouse=False, hook=None, **kwargs)
               -> <Fixture>
```

Creates a fixture that will take all values of the provided fixtures in order. That fixture is automatically registered into the callers' module, but you may wish to assign it to a variable for convenience. In that case make sure that you use the same name, e.g. `a = fixture_union('a', ['b', 'c'])`

The style of test ids corresponding to the union alternatives can be changed with `idstyle`. Three values are allowed:

 - `'explicit'` (default) favors readability,
 - `'compact'` adds a small mark so that at least one sees which parameters are union parameters and which others are normal parameters,
 - `None` does not change the ids.    

**Parameters:**

 - `name`: the name of the fixture to create
 - `fixtures`: an array-like containing fixture names and/or fixture symbols
 - `scope`: the scope of the union. Since the union depends on the sub-fixtures, it should be smaller than the smallest scope of fixtures referenced.
 - `idstyle`: The style of test ids corresponding to the union alternatives. One of `'explicit'` (default), `'compact'`, or `None`.
 - `unpack_into`: an optional iterable of names, or string containing coma-separated names, for additional fixtures to create to represent parts of this fixture. See `unpack_fixture` for details.
 - `ids`: as in pytest. The default value returns the correct fixture
 - `autouse`: as in pytest
 - `hook`: an optional hook to apply to each fixture function that is created during this call. The hook function will be called everytime a fixture is about to be created. It will receive a single argument (the function implementing the fixture) and should return the function to use. For example you can use `saved_fixture` from `pytest-harvest` as a hook in order to save all such created fixtures in the fixture store.
 - `kwargs`: other pytest fixture options. They might not be supported correctly.

**Outputs:** the new fixture. Note: you do not need to capture that output in a symbol, since the fixture is automatically registered in your module. However if you decide to do so make sure that you use the same name.

### `param_fixtures`

```python
param_fixtures(argnames, argvalues, 
               autouse=False, ids=None, scope="function", hook=None, **kwargs)
               -> Tuple[<Fixture>]
```

Creates one or several "parameters" fixtures - depending on the number or coma-separated names in `argnames`. The created fixtures are automatically registered into the callers' module, but you may wish to assign them to variables for convenience. In that case make sure that you use the same names, e.g. `p, q = param_fixtures('p,q', [(0, 1), (2, 3)])`.


Note that the `(argnames, argvalues, ids)` signature is similar to `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for consistency, see [pytest doc on parametrize](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html?highlight=pytest.param#pytest-mark-parametrize).

**Parameters:**

 - `argnames`: same as `@pytest.mark.parametrize` `argnames`.
 - `argvalues`: same as `@pytest.mark.parametrize` `argvalues`.
 - `autouse`: see fixture `autouse`
 - `ids`: same as `@pytest.mark.parametrize` `ids`
 - `scope`: see fixture `scope`    
 - `hook`: an optional hook to apply to each fixture function that is created during this call. The hook function will be called everytime a fixture is about to be created. It will receive a single argument (the function implementing the fixture) and should return the function to use. For example you can use `saved_fixture` from `pytest-harvest` as a hook in order to save all such created fixtures in the fixture store.
 - `kwargs`: any other argument for the created 'fixtures'

### `param_fixture`

```python
param_fixture(argname, argvalues, 
              autouse=False, ids=None, hook=None, scope="function", **kwargs)
              -> <Fixture>
```

Identical to `param_fixtures` but for a single parameter name, so that you can assign its output to a single variable.


### `@parametrize_plus`

```python
parametrize_plus(argnames, argvalues, 
                 indirect=False, ids=None, idstyle='explicit',
                 scope=None, hook=None, debug=False, **kwargs)
```

Equivalent to `@pytest.mark.parametrize` but also supports new possibilities in argvalues:

 - one can include references to fixtures with `fixture_ref(<fixture>)` where <fixture> can be the fixture name or fixture function. When such a fixture reference is detected in the argvalues, a new function-scope "union" fixture will be created with a unique name, and the test function will be wrapped so as to be injected with the correct parameters from this fixture. Special test ids will be created to illustrate the switching between the various normal parameters and fixtures. You can see debug print messages about all fixtures created using `debug=True`

 - one can include lazy argvalues with `lazy_value(<valuegetter>, [id=..., marks=...])`. A `lazy_value` is the same thing than a function-scoped fixture, except that the value getter function is not a fixture and therefore can neither be parametrized nor depend on fixtures. It should have no mandatory argument.

Both `fixture_ref` and `lazy_value` can be used to represent a single argvalue, or a whole tuple of argvalues when there are several argnames. Several of them can be used in a tuple.

Finally, `pytest.param` is supported even when there are `fixture_ref` and `lazy_value`. 

Here as for all functions above, an optional `hook` can be passed, to apply on each fixture function that is created during this call. The hook function will be called everytime a fixture is about to be created. It will receive a single argument (the function implementing the fixture) and should return the function to use. For example you can use `saved_fixture` from `pytest-harvest` as a hook in order to save all such created fixtures in the fixture store.
