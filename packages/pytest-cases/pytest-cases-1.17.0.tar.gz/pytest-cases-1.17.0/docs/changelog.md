# Changelog

### 1.17.0 - `lazy_value` improvements + annoying warnings suppression

 - `lazy_value` are now resolved at pytest `setup` stage, not pytest `call` stage. This is important for execution time recorded in the reports (see also `pytest-harvest` plugin). Fixes [#102](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/102) 

 - A function used as a `lazy_value` can now be marked with pytest marks. Fixes [#99](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/99)

 - A `lazy_value` now has a nicer id when it is a partial. Fixes [#97](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/97)
 
 - Removed annoying `PytestUnknownMarkWarning` warning message when a mark was used on a case. Fixes [#100](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/100)

### 1.16.0 - New `lazy_value` for parameters

 - New marker `lazy_value` for `parametrize_plus`. Fixes [#92](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/92)

### 1.15.0 - better `parametrize_plus` and smaller dependencies

 - Better support for `pytest.param` in `parametrize_plus` and also in `fixture_union` and `fixture_param[s]`. Improved corresponding ids. Fixed [#79](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/79) and [#86](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/86)
 
 - New `@ignore_unused` decorator to protect a fixture function from the "NOT_USED" case happening when the fixture is used in a fixture union.
  
 - Removed `six`, `wrapt` and `enum34` dependencies

 - (Internal) submodules reorganization for readability
 - (Internal) suppressed a lot of code quality warnings

### 1.14.0 - bugfixes and hook feature

 - Fixed `ids` precedence order when using `pytest.mark.parametrize` in a `fixture_plus`. Fixed [#87](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/87)

 - Fixed issue with `fixture_union` when using the same fixture twice in it. Fixes [#85](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/85)

 - Added the possibility to pass a `hook` function in all API where fixtures are created behind the scenes, so as to ease debugging and/or save fixtures (with `stored_fixture` from pytest harvest). Fixes [#83](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/83)
 
 - Fixture closures now support reordering when no unions are present. This suppressed the annoying warning "WARNING the new order is not taken into account !!" when it was not relevant. Fixes [#81](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/81)

### 1.13.1 - packaging improvements

 - packaging improvements: set the "universal wheel" flag to 1, and cleaned up the `setup.py`. In particular removed dependency to `six` for setup and added `py.typed` file. Fixes [#78](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/78)

### 1.13.0 - `@cases_generator` default `names`

`@cases_generator` now has a default value for the `names` template, based on the parameters. Fixes [#77](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/77).

### 1.12.4 - Bugfix

Fixed `ValueError` when a product of unions was used on a test node, for example when two `parametrize_plus` using `fixture_ref`s were used on the same fixture or test function. Fixed [#76](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/76)

### 1.12.3 - Improved error messages

Improved error message when something that is not a fixture is used in `unpack_fixture` or `fixture_union`. Fixed [#75](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/75)

### 1.12.2 - Warning fix

Fixed deprecation warning [#74](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/74)

### 1.12.1 - Bugfixes

 - Now using module name and not file path to detect symbols in cases files that are imported from elsewhere and not created locally. Indeed that was causing problems on some ^platforms where a `.pyc` cache file is created. Fixes [#72](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/72)

 - Fixed `PluginValidationError` when `pytest_fixture_plus` or `pytest_parametrize_plus` were used in a `conftest.py` file. Fixes [#71](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/71). According to discussion in [pytest#6475](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6475), `pytest_fixture_plus` and `pytest_parametrize_plus` are now renamed to `fixture_plus` and `parametrize_plus` in order for pytest (pluggy) not to think they are hooks. Old aliases will stay around for a few versions, with a deprecation warning.

### 1.12.0 - better test ids for parametrized tests with fixture refs + bugfix

 - Improved test ids for the cases where `fixture_ref` is used in the parameters list in `@pytest_parametrize_plus`. Fixed [#69](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/69). Thanks [`last-partizan`](https://github.com/last-partizan) for the suggestion !

 - Fixed `TypeError: got an unexpected keyword argument 'indirect'` with `pytest` 5+. Fixed [#70](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/70).

### 1.11.9 - bugfix

`FixtureClosureNode` is now able to properly handle `ignore_args`, and now supports that plugins append fixtures to the closure, such as pytest-asyncio. Added corresponding tests. Fixes [#68](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/68)

### 1.11.8 - bugfix

Fixed `KeyError` issue happening when a fixture is not found. Now users will see the "normal" error message from pytest (`"fixture <name> not found"`). Fixed [#67](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/67).

### 1.11.7 - bugfix

Fixed `ValueError` issue happening with indirectly parametrized fixtures. Fixed [#64](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/64).

### 1.11.6 - pyproject.toml

[raddessi](https://github.com/raddessi) added a `pyproject.toml` - thanks! Fixed [#65](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/65).

### 1.11.5 - bugfix

`pytest_parametrize_plus` was not working correctly with test classes, leading to `fixture 'self' not found`. Fixed [#63](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/63).

### 1.11.4 - python 2 bugfix

Fixed issue happening with `@pytest.mark.parametrize` with python 2. Fixed [#62](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/62).

### 1.11.3 - minor improvements

Better error message when users use `THIS_MODULE` in `cases=` instead of `module=`.

Added `__version__` package-level attribute.

### 1.11.2 - Increased tolerance to other plugins + bugfix

Now when other plugins try to manipulate the fixture closure, warning messages are emitted but no error is raised. Fixed [#55](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/55).

Also fixed issue [#58](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/58) happening with doctest.

### 1.11.1 - Added `six` dependency explicitly

It was missing from `setup.py`.

### 1.11.0 - `fixture_ref` can now be used inside tuples, leading to cross-products

Fixes [#47](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/47).

### 1.10.2 - More intuitive error messages

Now raising an explicit `InvalidParamsList` when pytest parametrize `argvalues` are incorrect. See [#54](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/54)

### 1.10.1 - Bugfix

Fixed [#52](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/52).

### 1.10.0 - New feature: fixtures unpacking

You can now unpack a fixture iterable into several individual fixtures using `unpack_fixture` or using `@pytest_fixture_plus(unpack_into=<names>)`. This is also available in `union_fixture(unpack_into=<names>)`. Fixed [#50](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/50) and [#51](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/51).

### 1.9.3 - Bugfix

Fixed issues when parametrize argnames contains a list. This fixed [#49](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/49)

### 1.9.2 - Bugfix with pytest 3.7 

Fixed [#48](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/48).

### 1.9.1 - Bugfix with pytest 3.7

Fixed [#48](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/48).

### 1.9.0 - New `--with-reorder` commandline option

New commandline option '--with-reorder' to change the reordering startegy currently in application. Fixes [#45](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/45).

The `--with-reorder` "skip" mode was not working correctly in presence of marks, fixed it. Fixed [#46](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/46).

### 1.8.1 - BugFixes

Ids should not be used when setting a NOT_USED parametrization. Fixes [#43](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/43)

Fixed issue with ordering and setup/teardown for higher-level scope fixtures (session and module scopes) when using union fixtures. Fixes [#44](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/44)

### 1.8.0 - Better ids for fixture unions

New:

 - `fixture_union` now accept a non-`None` value for `ids`. It also has a new `idstyle` argument allowing users to change the style of ids used. Finally `pytest_parametrize_plus` relies on this `ids` argument to set a more readable list of ids for the created union. Fixes [#41](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/41).

Misc:

 - Added non-regression test for fixture order. It passes already for all recent pytest versions (after 3.3). Fixes [#42](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/42)

### 1.7.0 - New `@pytest_parametrize_plus` allowing fixture references to be used in parameter values

New decorator `@pytest_parametrize_plus` able to handle the case where a `fixture_ref(<fixture_name>)` is present in the parameter values list. This decorator can be applied both on test functions and fixtures (if they are decorated with `@pytest_fixture_plus`). Fixes [#40](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/40)

Major refactoring of the "union fixtures" mechanism.

 - The `NOT_USED` status is now correctly propagated between dependent fixtures. This should fix a few cases where user fixtures were setup/teardown while not used in the current test node.
 - Empty fixture unions are not permitted anymore.
 - The way unions are handled in test parametrization was redesigned. The new design is based on a two-steps approach: first build the fixture closure for each node as a tree (and not a list as in `pytest`), and then apply parametrization intelligently based on this tree structure. This fixes several unintuitive behaviours that were happening with unions.

Note: interestingly this also fixes [pytest#5054](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5054).

### 1.6.3 - Minor exception enhancement

Improved the error message when the name template is wrong in `@cases_generator`. Fixes [#39](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/39).

### 1.6.2 - bug fixes

`fixture_union`:

 * Changed the repr of `NOT_USED` to `pytest_cases.NOT_USED`.

 * `@pytest_fixture_plus` now correctly handles the `NOT_USED` when fixtures in the union do not contain any parameter. Fixes [#38](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/38).

`param_fixtures`:

 * `param_fixtures` now delegates to `param_fixture` when a single parameter name is provided. This is more consistent. Fixed [#36](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/36).

 * `param_fixture[s]` now support all arguments from `fixture` (`scope` and `autouse` in particular).

### 1.6.1 - `@pytest_fixture_plus` improvement to handle `NOT_USED` cases

Fixed issue where fixtures get called with `NOT_USED` as a parameter when using a `fixture_union`. This issue is actually only fixed in `@pytest_fixture_plus`, if you use `@pytest.fixture` you have to handle it manually. Fixes [#37](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/37).

### 1.6.0 - `fixture_union` and `param_fixture[s]` bugfix

New `fixture_union` method to create a fixture that is the union/combination of other fixtures. This is an attempt to solve [this pytest proposal](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/proposals/parametrize_with_fixtures.html).

Also, `param_fixture` and `param_fixtures` can now be used without necessarily storing the return value into a variable: they will automatically register the created fixtures in the calling module.  

Finally, fixed a bug with `param_fixtures` when called to create a fixture for a single parameter.

### 1.5.1 - `param_fixtures` bugfix

Fixed `param_fixtures` issue: all parameter values were identical to the last parameter of the tuple. Fixes [#32](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/32).

### 1.5.0 - new helpers `param_fixture` and `param_fixtures`

Following [Sup3rGeo](https://github.com/Sup3rGeo)'s proposal, introduced two helper methods to create simple "parameter fixtures". Fixes [#31](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/31).

### 1.4.2 - parametrized `@pytest_fixture_plus` minor bug fix

`@pytest_fixture_plus` now correctly honors parameter id and marks overriden at single parameter level using `pytest.param`. Fixed [#30](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/30).

### 1.4.1 - parametrized `@pytest_fixture_plus` minor bug fix

Fixed `@pytest_fixture_plus` in case it is used with `parametrize` and one parameter is itself customized using `pytest.param`. Fixed [#29](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/29).

### 1.4.0 - `@pytest_fixture_plus` major improvement

 * Major improvement of `@pytest_fixture_plus`: instead of generating fixtures, it now correctly parametrizes the fixture. Skip/fail Marks are correctly copied too. Fixes [#28](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/28).

 * `pytest_fixture_plus` does not accept the `params` and `ids` arguments any more, it only relies on parametrization marks.

### 1.3.3 - parametrized `@pytest_fixture_plus` Bugfix

Fixed minor bug with parametrized `@pytest_fixture_plus`: spaces are now correctly removed when multiple parameter names are provided in the same `parametrize` call. Fixes [#27](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/27).

### 1.3.2 - parametrized `@pytest_fixture_plus` Bugfix

Fixed bug with `@pytest_fixture_plus` when used in parametrized mode. Fixes [#26](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/26). Thanks [Sup3rGeo](https://github.com/Sup3rGeo)!

### 1.3.1 - Minor dependency change

Now using `decopatch` to create the decorators.

### 1.3.0 - More flexible case generators names + Minor dependency change

Cases generators can now support explicit name lists, and name generator callables, in addition to the name template strings. Fixed [#24](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/24).

Dependency to `decorator` has been dropped and replaced with `makefun`. Fixed [#25](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/25).

### 1.2.2 - fixed bug with marks on cases with pytest 3.3

Marks on cases are now also working with pytest 3.3. Fixed [#23](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/23).

Ids for marked tests are now better managed. A new function `get_pytest_parametrize_args` is now used to transform the list of cases obtained by `get_all_cases(module)`, into the list of marked cases and ids required by `@pytest.mark.parametrize`. The doc has been updated to explain this for advanced users wishing to perform this step manually.

### 1.2.1 - fixed id of test cases with marks

Id of test cases with marks was appearing as `ParameterSet`. Fixed it.

### 1.2.0 - @pytest.mark can be used on cases + @pytest_fixture_plus parametrization order bugfix

Pytest marks such as `@pytest.mark.skipif` can now be used on case functions. As a consequence, `get_all_cases` is now the recommended function to use instead of `extract_cases_from_module` to perform manual collection. Indeed `get_all_cases` correctly prepares the resulting parameters list so that pytest sees the marks. Fixed [#21](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/21). 

Fixed parametrization order when `@pytest_fixture_plus` is used with several `@pytest.mark.parametrize`. Fixed [#22](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/22).

### 1.1.1 - Improved generated fixture names for `@pytest_fixture_plus`

When `@pytest_fixture_plus` is used on a function marked as parametrized, some fixtures are generated (one for each parameter). Generated fixture names now follow the pattern `<fixturename>__<paramname>`.
Fixed [#20](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/20).

### 1.1.0 - New `@pytest_fixture_plus`

New decorator `@pytest_fixture_plus` allows to use several `@pytest.mark.parametrize` on a fixture. Therefore one can use multiple `@cases_data` decorators, too. Fixes [#19](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/19).
*Note: this is a temporary feature, that will be removed if/when [pytest supports it](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3960).*

### 1.0.0 - `@cases_fixture` + pytest 2.x support 

Pytest 2.x is now supported. Fixes [#14](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/14).

**New feature:** `@cases_fixture` ! Now you can put your cases data retrieval in a fixture so that its duration does not enter into the test duration. This is particularly interesting if you use [pytest-harvest](https://smarie.github.io/python-pytest-harvest/) to create benchmarks: you probably do not want the case data retrieval/parsing to be counted in the test duration, especially if you use caching on the case function to accelerate subsequent retrievals. Fixes [#15](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/15).

### 0.10.1 - minor encoding issue in setup.py

### 0.10.0 - support for python 2

Python 2 is now supported. Fixed [#3](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/3). 

 - Note: `CaseData`, `Given`, `ExpectedNormal`, `ExpectedError`, and `MultipleStepsCaseData` type hints is not created in python 2 and python<3.5

### 0.9.1 - pytest-steps is now an independent project

 * Light refactoring: some internal function names are now private, and there are now two submodules.
 * [pytest-steps](https://smarie.github.io/python-pytest-steps/) is now an independent project. Examples in the documentation have been updated
 * New documentation page: API reference

### 0.8.0 - Filtering can now be done using a callable.

 * `@cases_data`: the `filter` argument now contains a filtering function. WARNING: the previous behaviour is still available but has been renamed `has_tag`. Fixes [#8](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/8).

### 0.7.0 - Hardcoded cases selection, and multi-module selection

 * `@cases_data` has a new parameters `cases` that can be used to hardcode a case or a list of cases. Its `module` parameter can also now take a list of modules

### 0.6.0 - Case parameters and better test suites

 * `get_for` is deprecated: it was too specific to a given case data format.
 * `MultipleStepsCaseData` was fixed to also support multiple inputs.
 * Case functions can now have parameters (even case generators). This is particularly useful for test suites. Fixes [#9](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/9).

### 0.5.0 - support for test suites

 * test functions can now be decorated with `@test_steps` to easily define a test suite with several steps. This fixes [#7](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/7).

### 0.4.0 - support for data caching with lru_cache

 * cases can now be decorated with `@lru_cache`. `@cases_generator` also provides a `lru_cache` parameter to enable caching. Fixes [#6](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/6).

### 0.3.0 - case generators

 * New decorator `@cases_generator` to define case generators. Fixes [#1](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/1).
 * Also, removed unused functions `is_expected_error_instance` and `assert_exception_equal`

### 0.2.0 - THIS_MODULE constant + Tagging/Filtering + doc

 * New constant `THIS_MODULE` so that cases and test functions can coexist in the same file. This fixes [#5](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/5).

 * Added `@test_target` and `@case_tags` decorators for case functions, and added `filter` parameter in `@cases_data`. This allows users to :
 
     * tag a case function with any item (and in particular with the reference to the function it relates to), 
     * and to filter the case functions used by a test function according to a particular tag.

   This fixes [#4](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-cases/issues/4).

 * Improved documentation

### 0.1.0 - First public version

 * Initial fork from private repo
