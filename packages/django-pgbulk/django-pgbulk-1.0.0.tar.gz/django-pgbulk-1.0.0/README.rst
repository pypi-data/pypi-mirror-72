django-pgbulk
#############

``django-pgplus``, forked from
`django-manager-utils <https://django-manager-utils.readthedocs.io>`__,
provides several optimized bulk operations for Postgres:

1. ``update`` - For updating a list of models in bulk. Although Django
   provides a ``bulk_update`` in 2.2, it performs individual updates for
   every row and does not perform a native bulk update.
2. ``upsert`` - For doing a bulk update or insert. This function uses
   postgres ``UPDATE ON CONFLICT`` syntax to perform an atomic upsert
   operation. There are several options to this function that allow the
   user to avoid touching rows if they result in a duplicate update, along
   with returning which rows were updated, created, or untouched.
3. ``sync`` - For syncing a list of models with a table. Does a bulk
   upsert and also deletes any rows in the source queryset that were not
   part of the input data.

`django-pgbulk docs <https://django-pgbulk.readthedocs.io/>`_.
