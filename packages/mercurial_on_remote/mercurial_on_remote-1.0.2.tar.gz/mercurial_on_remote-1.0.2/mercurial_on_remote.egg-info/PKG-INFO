        ====================================
        Mercurial OnRemote extension
        ====================================
        
        Execute some Mercurial command on remote repository (ssh/local repositories only).
        
        .. contents::
           :local:
           :depth: 2
        
        .. sectnum::
        
        Example
        =====================
        
        My two main use cases:
        
        - update remote directory after pushing::
        
            hg push staging
            hg onremote staging update -r tip 
        
        - check status and possibly commit in remote directory::
        
            hg onremote rhdevel status
            hg onremote rhdevel commit -m 'Forgotten typo'
        
        In those examples ``staging`` and ``rhdevel`` are remote paths, mapped
        to urls like ``ssh://some.machine.net/repos/myrepo`` (local paths work
        too). 
        
        Explicit path works too, but is much less handy::
        
            hg onremote ssh://euler.mydev.net/repos/myrepo   status
        
        Arguments
        ======================
        
        General command syntax::
        
            hg onremote «remote» «command» «arguments»
        
        where ``«remote»`` is remote repository alias or path, and remaining arguments
        constitute normal mercurial command.
        
        Option ``--ssh`` can be used just like with push or pull::
         
            hg onremote --ssh /custom/ssh staging status
        
        
        How does it work
        =================================================
        
        The extension simply resolves the specified path, and:
        
        - if it maps to local directory, executes ``hg --cwd that/directory «command» «arguments»``
        
        - if it maps to ssh path, executes ``ssh that/machine hg --cwd that/directory «command» «arguments»``
        
        - elsewhere (``http`` or other remote) it refuses to work.
        
        There is nothing particularly magical, the extension is intended to
        save some keystrokes and avoid flow interruption (I wrote it mainly
        to stop writing various *push and update* shell scripts).
        
        .. caution::
        
           You need true ssh access to have it working. Remote repositories,
           from ``bitbucket`` to ``mercurial-server`` installations will usually
           reject attempts to run commands (as one could expect).
        
        
        Configuration
        =================================================
        
        There is currently no dedicated configuration. 
        
        Standard mercurial settings are used to decide how to call
        ``ssh`` and which remote command to call to spawn Mercurial (see
        ``ssh`` and ``remotecmd`` settings in ``[ui]`` section). 
        This way ``onremote`` uses the same ``ssh`` command
        which is used by ``hg push`` and ``hg pull``, and the same
        mercurial name.
        
        
        Problems and limitations
        =================================================
        
        Interactive commands may fail to work properly due to lack
        of fully working console. 
        I recommend avoiding commands which trigger interactive prompts
        or editor spawns. If you try ``hg onremote commit`` add ``-m "Some message"``.
        
        .. note::
        
           At the moment OnRemote doesn't initialize full terminal support
           (technically, doesn't add ``ssh -t`` or similar). It may
           change in the future.
        
        Installation
        =================================================
        
        Mercurial ≥ 3.4 is required (attempts to run on older version will
        result in crashes) and Mercurial ≥ 4.5 is strongly recommended
        (versions 3.4-4.4 involve some hacks which may fail for more
        complicated arguments).
        
        Linux/Unix (from PyPI)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you have working ``pip`` or ``easy_install``::
        
            pip install --user mercurial_on_remote
        
        or maybe::
        
            sudo pip install mercurial_on_remote
        
        (or use ``easy_install`` instead of ``pip``). Then activate by::
        
            [extensions]
            mercurial_on_remote =
        
        To upgrade, repeat the same command with ``--upgrade`` option, for
        example::
        
            pip install --user --upgrade mercurial_on_remote
        
        Linux/Unix (from source)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you don't have ``pip``, or wish to follow development more closely:
        
        - clone both this repository and `mercurial_extension_utils`_ and put
          them in the same directory, for example::
        
            cd ~/sources
            hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-extension_utils/
            hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-on_remote/
        
        - update to newest tags,
        
        - activate by::
        
            [extensions]
            mercurial_on_remote = ~/sources/mercurial-on_remote/mercurial_on_remote.py
        
        To upgrade, pull and update.
        
        See `mercurial_extension_utils`_ for longer description of this kind
        of installation.
        
        Windows
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you have any Python installed, you may install with ``pip``::
        
            pip install mercurial_on_remote
        
        Still, as Mercurial (whether taken from TortoiseHg_, or own package)
        uses it's own bundled Python, you must activate by specifying the path::
        
            [extensions]
            mercurial_on_remote = C:/Python27/Lib/site-packages/mercurial_on_remote.py
            ;; Or wherever pip installed it
        
        To upgrade to new version::
        
            pip --upgrade mercurial_on_remote
        
        If you don't have any Python, clone repositories::
        
            cd c:\hgplugins
            hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-extension_utils/
            hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-on_remote/
        
        update to tagged versions and activate by path::
        
            [extensions]
            mercurial_on_remote = C:/hgplugins/mercurial-on_remote/mercurial_on_remote.py
            ;; Or wherever you cloned
        
        See `mercurial_extension_utils`_ documentation for more details on
        Windows installation.
