Description: # EllucianEthosPythonClient
        Python Client Library for interfacing with Ellucian Ethos. It is built by some members of the Ethos customer the 
        community. 
        
        Currently in development -and not fully tested for production use.
        
        ## Aims
        
        This library aims to provide:
        
         - Wrapper class to handle Ethos authorizations
         - Wrapper classes that call Ellucian API's to fetch resources
         - Common updates on resources
         - Change notification poller
         - Provide mock running mode to allow for testing without calling Ethos
         
        ## Usage examples
        
         - For a quick start usage example using the python REPL console follow the [Quickstart](./docs/QUICKSTART.md) guide.
         - For examples of using the poller functionality see [Poller Guide](./docs/POLLERGUIDE.md)
         - For sample scripts see [Sample scripts directory](./samples)
        
        ## Background
        
        I started putting this python library after an Ethos user group meeting. There are a number of other Ellucian customers
        all writing clients and I wanted to take the opportunity of digging out exmaples I had written for myself and my team
        and sharing them with the community. I hope that publishing this library is useful to other Ethos users and hope to 
        collaborate on improving it further. Please feel free to submit feedback, issues and pull requests.
