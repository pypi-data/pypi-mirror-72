	"""
    Take a cloud X of P points in Q dimensions (i.e., X.shape->(P,Q)) and compute
	a discrete-support probability mass function on a Q-dimensional grid.
	The number of elements of the grid along one dimension is N, is given, or 
	computed from step d.
	delta_c is the euclidean radius under which points of the cloud are 
	associated with the points of the Q-dimensional grid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : float, array
        Input array. Rows are points, columns are coordinates.
    N : int, optional (N (x)or d must be given)
        Number of elements of the grid along one dimension.
    d : float, optional (N (x)or d must be given)
        Step between the elements of the grid along one dimension.
    delta_c : float, optional
        Euclidean radius under which points of the cloud are 
		associated with the points of the Q-dimensional grid.
		If not given, computed as the greatest width divided by N.
	return_grid : bool, default=True
        If True, return the support of the N**Q grid points.
	lims : array of 2-tuples
		Spatial limits of the computed probability distribution
		function. Must have Q 2-tuples

    Returns
    -------
    pmf : ndarray
        The N**Q point array. 
		If True, return the support of the N**Q grid points,
		it returns (grid,pmf)
