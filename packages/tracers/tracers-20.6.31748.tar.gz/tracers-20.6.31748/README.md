## Key Features

- Handles **any callable** object, which includes **your own code**,
  **third party libraries**, and even the low-level **Python standard library**
- Handles [**async**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) code
  **out-of-the box**, no config required
- Exposes a **high-level API**:
  - `@trace` decorator (which internally handles async/sync cases)
- It's **Thread-safe**, **Async-safe**, **Process-safe** and **Context-safe**
  - Accurate results in any scenario
  - No worries about leaking, bleeding, corrupting, or locking stuff into other
    code
- Introduces **zero overhead** in production!
  - The `@trace` decorator accepts a `do_trace` parameter
    that you can dynamically set to `True` of `False` to differentiate
    testing environments from production environments
- It's **easy to deploy**
  - No external dependencies!
- It's easy to pin-point performance problems:
  - Gives you the total execution time in seconds and **%**
  - Allows you to identify points in time where your **async** event loop got blocked
- Allows you to measure monotonic (wall time), process time, and thread time out-of-the box
- Profiles without using dirty introspection stuff
  - The main code is just 50 lines long, pretty high level, go and read it :)

# Quick Introduction

Let's start with a very basic example:

```py
import time
from dateutil.parser import parse


def example():
    time.sleep(2.0)
    your_business_logic('Sat Oct 11')


def your_business_logic(date: str):
    parse(date)
    time.sleep(1.0)


example()
```

Tracing its flow and gathering profiling information is a matter of
decorating your functions:

```diff
--- a/examples/without_tracers.py
+++ b/examples/with_tracers.py
@@ -1,15 +1,18 @@
 import time
 from dateutil.parser import parse
+from tracers.function import trace


+@trace
 def example():
     time.sleep(2.0)
     your_business_logic('Sat Oct 11')


+@trace
 def your_business_logic(date: str):
     parse(date)
     time.sleep(1.0)


 example()
```

If you run it, all the functions you decorated will be traced
and you'll have metrics of the execution flow:

     1     0.00s     2.00s [ 66.7%]     3.00s [100.0%]    âœ“ example
     2     2.00s     1.00s [ 33.3%]     1.00s [ 33.3%]    Â¦   âœ“ your_business_logic
```

From the output you can conclude:
- executing function *example* took a total of *3.0* seconds to complete
- function *example* takes *66.7%* of the execution time
- function *example encloses *100%* of your code time
- function *example* called function: *your_business_logic*
- function *your_business_logic* took *1.0* seconds out of the *3.0* seconds
  the function *example* needed to complete
- function *your_business_logic* represents *33.3%* of your execution time

Tracing code is not limited to your own code.
You can trace any **callable object** including **third party packages**,
**Python's standard library**, and almost anything

The level of detail is up to you!
