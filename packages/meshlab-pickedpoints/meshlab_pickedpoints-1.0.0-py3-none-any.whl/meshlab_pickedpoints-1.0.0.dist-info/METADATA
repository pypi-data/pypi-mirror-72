## Acknowledgements

This library was based on code in [Lace][], which was refactored from legacy
code at Body Labs by [Alex Weiss][], with portions by [Eric Rachlin][],
[Paul Melnikow][], [Victor Alvarez][], and others. Later it was extracted
from the Body Labs codebase and open-sourced by [Guillaume Marceau][]. In
2018 it was [forked by Paul Melnikow][fork] and published as
[metabolace][fork pypi]. Thanks to a repository and package transfer from
Body Labs, the fork has been merged back into the original.
