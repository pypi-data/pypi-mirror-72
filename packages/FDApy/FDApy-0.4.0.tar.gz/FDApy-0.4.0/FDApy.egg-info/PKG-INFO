Description: Functional Data Analysis, usually referred as FDA, concerns the field of
        Statistics that deals with discrete observations of continuous d-dimensional
        functions.
        
        This package provide modules for the analysis of such data. It includes
        methods for different dimensional data as well as irregularly sampled
        functional data. An implementation of (multivariate) functional principal
        component analysis is also given. Moreover, a simulation toolbox is provided.
        It might be used to simulate different clusters of functional data.
        
        Check out the `documentation <https://fdapy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for
        more complete information on the available features within the package.
