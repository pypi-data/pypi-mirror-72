asyncpraw, an acronym for "Python Reddit API Wrapper", is a python package that
allows for simple access to Reddit's API. asyncpraw aims to be easy to use and
internally follows all of `Reddit's API rules
<https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API>`_. With asyncpraw there's no need to
introduce ``sleep`` calls in your code. Give your client an appropriate user
agent and you're set.

.. _installation:

Installation
------------

asyncpraw is supported on python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6. The recommended way to
install asyncpraw is via `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install asyncpraw

To install the latest development version of asyncpraw run the following instead:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade https://github.com/asyncpraw-dev/asyncpraw/archive/master.zip

For instructions on installing python and pip see "The Hitchhiker's Guide to
Python" `Installation Guides
<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/>`_.

Quickstart
----------

Assuming you already have a credentials for a script-type OAuth application you
can instantiate an instance of asyncpraw like so:

.. code-block:: python

  import asyncpraw
  reddit = asyncpraw.Reddit(client_id='CLIENT_ID', client_secret="CLIENT_SECRET",
                       password='PASSWORD', user_agent='USERAGENT',
                       username='USERNAME')

With the ``reddit`` instance you can then interact with Reddit:

.. code-block:: python

  # Create a submission to /r/test
  reddit.subreddit('test').submit('Test Submission', url='https://reddit.com')

  # Comment on a known submission
  submission = reddit.submission(url='https://www.reddit.com/comments/5e1az9')
  submission.reply('Super rad!')

  # Reply to the first comment of a weekly top thread of a moderated community
  submission = next(reddit.subreddit('mod').top('week'))
  submission.comments[0].reply('An automated reply')

  # Output score for the first 256 items on the frontpage
  for submission in reddit.front.hot(limit=256):
      print(submission.score)

  # Obtain the moderator listing for redditdev
  for moderator in reddit.subreddit('redditdev').moderator:
      print(moderator)
