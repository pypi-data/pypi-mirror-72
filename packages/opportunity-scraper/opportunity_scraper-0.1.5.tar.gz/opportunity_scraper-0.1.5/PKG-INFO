        `opportunity_scraper` is a Python3 script for scraping R&D competition websites and dumping the results into the SuiteCRM V8 API.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

        ```
        
        ### Dependencies
        
        `opportunity_scraper` uses [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/), and will not work without it. Download the appropriate `chromedriver` version for your Chrome or Chromium version.
        
        ## Supported resources
        
        - [UK Government Innovation Funding Service](https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/competition/search)
        - [KTN Innovation Exchange](https://www.ktninnovationexchange.co.uk/challenges)
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### SuiteCRM OAuth2 credentials
        
        Before using the scraper, you need to create some SuiteCRM OAuth2 credentials for the script to use.
        
        - Navigate to the `OAuth2 Clients and Tokens` admin page (`https://www.your-suitecrm-instance.com/suitecrm/index.php?module=OAuth2Clients`)
        - Create a new `Client Credentials Client`
        
        The client ID and secret will be used in configuration.
        
        ### Configuration
        
        Configuration is via a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file.
        
        The default location is `~/.config/opportunity_scraper/settings.yaml`, but this can be changed with the `--config` CLI option at runtime.
        
        The following can be used as a template for the config file. All values are required.
        
        ```yaml
        browser:
            # Location of chromedriver
            chromedriver: "/usr/bin/chromedriver"
            # Credentials for KTN Innovation Exchange
            ktn_username: "dummy@example.com"
            ktn_password: "somesecretpassword"
        
        oauth:
            # SuiteCRM OAuth2 credentials
            token_url: "https://example.com/suitecrm/Api/access_token"
            client_id: "some-uuid-token"
            client_secret: "anotherpassword"
        
        suitecrm:
            # SuiteCRM API
            api_url: "https://example.com/suitecrm/Api"
            # Account name / ID for .gov.uk competitions
            govuk_account_name: "Opportunity Account Name"
            govuk_account_id: "another-uuid"
            # Account name / ID for KTN competitions
            ktn_account_name: "Opportunity Account Name"
            ktn_account_id: "another-uuid"
            # Default user to be assigned new opportunities
            assigned_user_name: "admin"
            assigned_user_id: "1"
