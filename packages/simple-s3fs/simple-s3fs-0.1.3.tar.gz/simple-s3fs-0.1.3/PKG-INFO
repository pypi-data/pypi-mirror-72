Description: # simple-s3fs
        
        A simple (read-only) FUSE-based file system for S3 buckets.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        simple-s3fs --aws-profile default -f -l /tmp/s3.log /tmp/s3/<bucket>
        less /tmp/s3/<bucket>/folder/file.txt
        ```
        
        Please note: Folders in buckets cannot have `.` in their names and files must have an extension (i.e. a `.`)
        
        
        ## Unmounting
        
        ```
        umount /tmp/s3/<bucket>
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        The recommended way to develop `simple-s3fs` is to use a [conda](https://conda.io/docs/intro.html) environment and
        install `simple-s3fs` with develop mode:
        
        ```shell
        pip install -e .
        ```
