        ====
        
        Welcome to `AsyncWago <http://github.com/M-o-a-T/asyncwago>`__!
        
        This library controls access to I/O on Wago controllers.
        These are industrial devices with various analog and digital extension modules.
        They run a basic embedded Linux. Older models don't even have a MMU.
        
        A small control program needs to run on the controller.
        You can get its source from the `Wago Firmware <http://github.com/M-o-a-T/wago-firmware>`__ archive.
