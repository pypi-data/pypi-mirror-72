    Before the log area of a `canlib.kvmlib.Memorator` object has been mounted,
    its `log` attribute is set to an instance of this class.

    This class has all the functionality available even when the log area has
    not been mounted -- this functionality is still present after the log area
    has been mounted (or if the area is always mounted -- see
    `canlib.kvmlib.Kmf`).

    The number of log files can be read as the ``len()`` of this object
    (``container`` is either a `canlib.kvmlib.Memorator` or `canlib.kvmlib.Kmf`
    object)::

    Once a `canlib.kvmlib.Memorator` object has been mounted, its `log`
    attribute is set to an instance of this class. This is the preferred way of
    using this class.

    For `canlib.kvmlib.Kmf` objects, the `log` attribute is always an instance
    of this class as they are by definition mounted.

    In the following examples ``container`` can be either a
    `canlib.kvmlib.Memorator` object that has been mounted, or a
    `canlib.kvmlib.Kmf` object.

    The files within the log can be accessed via indexing::

        container.log[index]

    or all files can be iterated over::

        for log_file in container.log:
            ...

    The log area can also be validated::

            container.log.validate()

    Also see the super class `canlib.kvmlib.UnmountedLog` for functionality
    this class has inherited.
