        ## About <a name = "about"></a>
        
        "ggpp" is a simple g++ interface made with python3, it is useful to run C/C++ code in only one command.<br>
        So, instead of:<br>
        `g++ example.cpp -o example`<br>
        `./example`<br>
        And sometimes you don't want the compiled file. So, you also do:<br>
        `rm -rf example`<br>
        All theses steps, can be reduced with ggpp to:<br>
        
        ```
        ggpp example.cpp
        ```
        
        And you will run your C/C++ code without (optionally) leaving a compiled file on the folder.<br>
        
        ## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
        
        Install ggpp is very simple.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        You will need **python3** installed on your PC.<br>
        For Python 3 installation, download on the [official page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).<br>
        
        - Python 3 is already installed on the most linux distributions.<br>
          Try run "`python3`" on your shell.
        
        As the ggpp is a **g++** interface, you will need it installed too.
        
        As a plus, if you want to copy the content of you C/C++ code automatically after ran it, you will need **xclip** installed on linux. <br>
        For install it, you can follow this [useful guide](https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/copy-paste-commands-output-xclip-linux/). <br>
        On Windows, to copy the content, you don't need any prerequisites.
        
        ### Installing
        
        Download or clone this repository
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/davigsousa/ggpp.git
        ```
        
        Then, open the repository folder
        
        ```
        cd ggpp
        ```
        
        And run pip3 to install the package.
        
        ```
        pip3 install .
        ```
        
        Now, restart your shell and you will be able to use ggpp, try:
        
        ```
        ggpp --help
        ```
        
        ## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>
        
        You can run your C/C++ code,<br>
        just passing the filename as first argument. On Windows, you need file path, like: .\targetfile.cpp <br>
        
        ```
        ggpp targetfile.cpp
        ```
        
        You can also pass arguments to the g++ just passing in the end.
        
        ```
        ggpp targetfile.cpp -Wall -H
        ```
        
        Currently, there are two arguments to configure ggpp,<br>
        they are "-c" or "--clip" to copy file content to the clipboard (xclip is required on linux), <br>
        And "-nr" or "--noremove" to make ggpp do not remove the compiled file.
        
        Usage:
        
        ```
        ggpp example.cpp -c -nr
        ```
