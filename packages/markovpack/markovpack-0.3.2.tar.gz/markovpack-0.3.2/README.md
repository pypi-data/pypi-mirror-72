# `markovpack`

A [Royalnet](https://github.com/Steffo99/royalnet) pack to have fun with [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify)!

## Usage

1. Create a new directory in the working directory of the Royalnet instance.
2. Place there the `.json` files generated by the `text.to_json()` method of markovify's NewLineTexts.
3. In the `config.toml` of the Royalnet instance, set the following values:
   ```toml
   [Packs."markovpack"]
   Markov.models_directory = "markovpack"  # The name of the directory containing the .json files
   Markov.default_model = "example"  # The name of the .json file that should be parsed if no arguments are passed to the command 
   Markov.min_words = 5  # The minimum number of words a sentence should have to be sent
   ```
4. Start Royalnet with `python -m royalnet` and have fun!
