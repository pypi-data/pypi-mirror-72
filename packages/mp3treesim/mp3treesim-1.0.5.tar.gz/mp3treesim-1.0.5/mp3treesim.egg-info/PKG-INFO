        # MP3-treesim
        
        Triplet-based similarity score for fully multi-labeled trees with poly-occurring labels.
        
        ```
            usage: __main__.py [-h] [-i | -u | -g] [--labeled-only]
                           [--exclude [EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]]]
                           TREE TREE
        
            MP3 tree similarity measure
        
            positional arguments:
            TREE                  Paths to the trees
        
            optional arguments:
            -h, --help            show this help message and exit
            -i                    Run MP3-treesim in Intersection mode.
            -u                    Run MP3-treesim in Union mode.
            -g                    Run MP3-treesim in Geometric mode.
            --labeled-only        Ingore nodes without "label" attribute. The trees will
                                    be interpred as partially-label trees.
            --exclude [EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]]
                                    String(s) of comma separated labels to exclude from
                                    computation. If only one string is provided the labels
                                    will be excluded from both trees. If two strings are
                                    provided they will be excluded from the respective
                                    tree. E.g.: --exclude "A,D,E" will exclude labels from
                                    both trees; --exclude "A,B" "C,F" will exclude A,B
                                    from Tree 1 and C,F from Tree 2; --exclude "" "C" will
                                    exclude and C from Tree 2 and nothing from Tree 1
        
        ```
