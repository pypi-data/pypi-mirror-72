        Networking-Ansible ML2 Driver
        =============================
        
        Overview
        --------
        Networking-Ansible is a Neutron ML2 driver that abstracts the management and
        interaction with switching hardware to Ansible Networking. This driver is not
        tested with all the modules included with Ansible Networking. In theory it
        should work with any switch that has compatible modules included with Ansible
        Networking if the provider tasks are added to the Ansible openstack-ml2 role
        included with this driver. See the contributor documentation for more information
        about adding support for an Ansible Networking driver to the openstack-ml2
        Ansible role.

        Components
        ----------
        The Networking-Ansible ML2 Driver consists of the following components:
        
        ``networking_ansible`` ML2 Driver
          Invoked by neutron to configure L2 networking for tenant networks.
        
        Use Cases
        ---------
        ``Ironic Baremetal Guest Deployment``
        
        Ironic uses Networking-Ansible to configure the switch ports for the baremetal guests.
        Ironic needs to swap the port a baremetal guest is connected to between the
        Ironic provisioning network and the tenant VLAN that the guest is assigned.
        
        Features
        --------
        * On create network a vlan can be defined
        * On port update will assign a vlan to an access port or trunk port.
