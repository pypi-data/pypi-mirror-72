Description: ## My Calculator
        
        This package computes the various computations of Maths like :
        * Greatest Common Divisor
        * Lowest Common Multiple
        * Reducing Fraction
        
        ## Installations
        __Through pypi package__
        ``` Shell
        $ pip install my-calculator
        ```
        
        __From Source__
        ``` Shell
        $ git clone git@github.com:ghimireadarsh/My-Calculator.git
        $ cd My-Calculator
        $ pip install . 
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        After the package is installed, several operation can be performed like:
        
        __Greatest Common Divisor__
        ``` Python
        from my_calculator import Calculator
        Calculator.gcd(8, 16, 24)
        # Output : 8
        Calculator.gcd(10, 12)
        # Output : 2
        
        ```
        
        __Lowest Common Multiple__
        ``` Python
        from my_calculator import Calculator
        Calculator.lcm(10, 20, 30)
        # Output : 60
        Calculator.lcm(10,5)
        # Output : 10
        ```
        
        __Fraction reducer__
        ``` Python
        from my_calculator import Calculator
        Calculator.reduce_fraction(10,12)
        # Output : (5,6)
        ```
