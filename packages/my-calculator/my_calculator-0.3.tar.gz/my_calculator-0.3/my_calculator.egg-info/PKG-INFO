Description: ## My Calculator
        
        This package computes the various computations of Maths like :
        * Greatest Common Divisor
        * Lowest Common Multiple
        * Reducing Fraction
        
        ## Installations
        __Through pypi package__
        ``` Shell
        $ pip install my-calculator
        ```

        ## Usage
        After the package is installed, several operation can be performed like:
        
        __Greatest Common Divisor__
        ``` Python
        from my_calculator import Calculator
        Calculator.gcd(10,12)
        # Output : 2
        ```
        
        __Lowest Common Multiple__
        ``` Python
        from my_calculator import Calculator
        Calculator.lcm(10,12)
