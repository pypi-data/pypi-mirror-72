"""
Implementation of LRU Cache.
Implementing Cache in a separate class/file allows for robust testing and is a practice of loose-coupling.
It allows, in future, to implement other types of cache (eviction policy) and just interchange different types of cache.
Also, it allows clean code, in other places using cache.
Allows for easier reasoning of code.

# Tested against leetcode's test cases: https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/359080389/
In project, test cases would be way better though.
