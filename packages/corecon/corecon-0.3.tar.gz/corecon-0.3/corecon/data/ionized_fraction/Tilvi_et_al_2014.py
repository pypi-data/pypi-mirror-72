Based on deep near-IR spectroscopy of z >~ 7 galaxies using MOSFIRE on the Keck-I Telescope.
Bayesian formalism, combining such data with literature. At z ~ 8 the LyÎ± fraction has dropped by a factor of >3 compared to the z ~ 6.
Comparison with theoretical models implies the IGM volume averaged neutral hydrogen fraction >~ 0.3.
