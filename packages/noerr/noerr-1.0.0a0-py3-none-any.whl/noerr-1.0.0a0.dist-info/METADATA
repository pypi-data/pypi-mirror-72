# noerr

Catch exceptions via context manager in Python.

Super simple to use:

```python
from noerr import no_err

with no_err:
    raise Exception("This won't crash my code!")

print("Yup, still going with no error!")
```

Also possible to log errors:


```python
from noerr import log_err

with log_err:
    raise Exception("Should probably warn the user about this one.")

print("We now see the error, but don't stop because of it")
```

Outputs:
```
Exception logged by "LogError"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 4, in <module>
Exception: Should probably warn the user about this one.

We now see the error, but don't stop because of it
```

## Install 

```
pip install noerr
```
