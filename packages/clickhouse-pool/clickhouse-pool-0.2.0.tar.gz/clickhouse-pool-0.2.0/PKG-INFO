Description: # ClickHouse Pool for Python
        
        A thread-safe connection pool for ClickHouse. Inspired by `psycopg2` and using
        [`clickhouse-driver`](https://github.com/mymarilyn/clickhouse-driver) for
        connections.
        
        ## Installation
        
        `pip install clickhouse-pool`
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        ```python
        from clickhouse_pool.pool import ChPool
        
        # create a pool
        pool = ChPool()
        
        # get a clickhouse-driver client
        with pool.get_client() as client:
            # execute sql and print the result
            result = client.execute("SELECT * FROM system.numbers LIMIT 5")
            print(result)
        
        # always close all connections in the pool once you're done with it
        pool.close_all_connections()
        ```
        
        ## Connection Pool Size
        
        To change the connection pool size,
        
        ```python
        # create a pool with minimum 20 connections and a max of 40
        pool = ChPool(connections_min=20, connections_max=40)
        
        # get a clickhouse-driver client
        with pool.get_client() as client:
            # execute sql and print the result
            result = client.execute("SELECT * FROM system.numbers LIMIT 5")
            print(result)
        
        # always close all connections in the pool once you're done with it
        pool.close_all_connections()
        ```
