Also, we provide a bunch of additional markers:\n\n- `sys_version_info` is the same as [`sys.version_info`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.version_info)\n- `os_environ` is the same as [`os.environ`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.environ)\n- `is_installed` is our custom function that tries to import the passed string, returns `bool` value\n- `package_version` is our custom function that tries to get package version from `pkg_resources` and returns its [parsed version](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/version/#packaging.version.parse)\n\nUse `get_env_info` to get values for the current environment:\n\n```python\nfrom coverage_conditional_plugin import get_env_info\n\nget_env_info()\n```\n\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](https://github.com/wemake.services/coverage-conditional-plugin/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n\n## Credits\n\nThis project was generated with [`wemake-python-package`](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-python-package).
