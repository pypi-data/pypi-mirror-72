Description: # `badass`: (not so) bad assessments
        
        `badass` helps to produce automated assessments of programming
        projects. It is likely to produce bad assessments of good projects,
        but good assessments of bad projects. Indeed, it can test:
        
         * if the project compiles
         * the return values of functions on defined test cases
         * static properties on the code
         * traces of the execution
         
        But it cannot test:
        
         * code readability and clarity
         * algorithm relevance and quality
         * all such aspects one would like to test on good projects
        
        So, bad projects are likely to fail on the first group of tests, while
        good project will pass and thus remain to be assessed manually.
        
        The main goal of `badass` is thus to quickly produce superficial
        assessments for a large number of students, allowing to focus on the
        best projects for a manual analysis.
        
        ## Security
        
        `badass` will execute all foreign code inside a sandbox provided
        by [`firejail`](http://firejail.wordpress.com/) so you won't harm your
        system executing malicious or badly programmed projects.
        
        ## Current state and future
        
        This is a very early version:
        
         * limited to C projects
         * tests are provided as the `main` function
         * other tests have to be programmed by hand to analyse:
           * the source code
           * the `strace` log of the program
         
        In the future versions, we may have:
        
         * online submission of projects and report to the students on a given
           set of tests
         * final assessment on extended test
         * copy/paste detection between projects
         * a library of standard tests on source code and `strace` logs
