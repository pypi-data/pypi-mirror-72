        This package contains utilities which allow you to create a corpus of decisions from the 
        Personal Data Protection Commission of Singapore's 
        [Data Protection Enforcement Cases](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Commissions-Decisions).
        
        The primary use of such a corpus is for studying, possibly using data science tools such as 
        natural language processing.
        
        It currently has the following features:
        
        * Visit the Personal Data Protection Commission of Singapore's 
        [Data Protection Enforcement Cases](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Commissions-Decisions)
        and compile a table of decisions with information from the summaries provided by the PDPC for each case.
        * Save this table of decisions as CSV
        * Download all the PDF files of the decisions from the PDPC's website. 
        If the decision is not a PDF, collects the information provided on the decision web page and saves it as a text file.
        * Convert the PDF files into text files
        
        ## Features provided by scraper
        
        * Published date
        * Respondent
        * Title
        * Summary
        * URL of PDF of decision
        
        The features are discovered by passing `--extras` to the command.
        * **[Extras]** Citation
        * **[Extras]** Basic enforcement information (Financial penalty, warning, directions)
        * **[Extras]** References (referred by, referring to)
        
        ## What pdpc-decisions uses
        * Python 3
        * PDF Miner
        * Selenium
        * Chrome
        * spaCy
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Docker Image
        
        I dockerised the application for my personal ease of use.
        It is probably the easiest and most straight-forward way 
        to use the application and I recommend it too.
        The dockerised application also contains all pre-requisites
        so there is no need for any manual installs.
        
        You need to have docker installed. 
        Pull the image from [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/houfu/pdpc-decisions).
        ```shell script
        docker pull houfu/pdpc-decisions
        ```
        
        After that you can run the image and pass commands and arguments to it.
        For example, if you would like the application to do all actions.
        
        ```shell script
        docker run houfu/pdpc-decisions all
        ```
        
        This isn't clever because downloads will be stored in the docker image 
        and not easily accessed. Bind a volume in your filesystem and 
        use the `--root` option to direct the application
        to save the files there. For example:
        
        ```shell script
        docker run \ 
          --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/target,target=/code/download \ # Target directory must exist!
          houfu/pdpc-decisions \
          all \
          --root /code/download/
        ```
        
        ### Local install
        * Install via PIP
        
        ```shell script
        pip install pdpc-decisions
        ```
        
        * Once the package is installed, used the command line tool `pdpc-decisions` to use the script.
        
        * If necessary, install [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) 
        and [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) for Selenium to work.
        
        The main entry point for the script is `pdpcdecision.py`
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        The script accepts the following actions and options:
        
        Accepts the following actions.
        
          "`all`"       Does all the actions (scraping the website, saving a csv,
          downloading all files and creating a corpus).
        
          "`corpus`"    Converts PDF format of decisions into plain text files.
        
          "`csv`"      Save the items gathered by the scraper as a csv file.
        
          "`files`"     Downloads all the decisions from the PDPC website into a
          folder.
        
        Options:
          
          `--csv FILE`            Filename for saving the items gathered by scraper as a
                                csv file.  [default: scrape_results.csv]
          
          `--download DIRECTORY`  Destination folder for downloads of all PDF/web pages
                                of PDPC decisions  [default: download/]
          
          `--corpus DIRECTORY`    Destination folder for PDPC decisions converted to
                                text files  [default: corpus/]
          `-r, --root DIRECTORY`  Root directory for downloads and files  [default:
                                Your current working directory]
          
          `--extras/--no-extras`         Add extra features to the data collected. This increases processing time. This feature is ignored if action is `files` or `downloads`. 
                                        (Experimental and requires reading of actual decisions)
                                        [default: *False*, '--no-extras']
          
          `--verbose`               Verbose output
          
          `--help`                Show this message and exit.
