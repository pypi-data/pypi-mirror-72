        # Description
        
        Bitcoin price is a fickle thing. You never really know where it's going to be at the end of the day.So, instead constantly checking various sites for the latest updates, let's make a python app to do the work for you
        
        * For this project we are going to use the popular autimation website IFTTT.
        * we're going to create required number of applets and choose the service and the app to get the notification like twitter, telegram or SMS and also gmail service.
        * Among applets, create the one applet for the emergency notification when the Bitcoin price falls under a certain threshold and the emergency notifications and one for the normal price notifications to the app which the user choose.
        * These will be triggered by our python app which will consume the data from the Coinmaretcap.com.
        * An IFTTT applet is composed of two parts like trigger and the action.
        * Trigger will be webhook service provided by IFTTT.
        * Our python app will make an HTTP request to the webhook URL whcih will trigger an action.Now, the action could be almost anything you want. IFTTT offers a multiple actions like sending a notifications or SMS.
