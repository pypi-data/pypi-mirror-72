        ## Wiki text conversions based on MediaWiki 
        
        This program parses a dialect of MediaWiki syntax and converts it
        to various formats (html, plain text and markdown).
        
        This is intended for documentation written using the MediaWiki syntax
        instead of the Markdown syntax as is more popularly used these days;
        there are no wiki features such as internal links implemented.
        
        Tables and definition lists are supported.
        
        The markdown and text versions of this file are converted using
        this utility.
        
        ## Options 
        
        Summary
        
            Options:
             -h, --help show this help message and exit
             -o FILE write to this file (default stdout)
             -t TYPE, --type=TYPE select output type
             -l NUMBER, --first-level=NUMBER
        
        The output TYPE can be one of:
        <dl>
        <dt> text
        <dd>plain text output
        <dt> html
        <dd>- html output
        <dt> md 
        <dd>markdown output
        <dt> md_safe 
        <dd>markdown output with html restricted to a 'safe' subset.
        <dt> mw 
        <dd>mediawiki output, the output will be a normalized form of the
        input. It will also be affected by the _first-level_ option if
        given.
        </dl>
        
        The first-level option sets the first heading level in
        the output. So if it is set to 1, the the first heading will
        be **H1** in html regardless of what level it is in the input
        and all the other headings adjusted appropriately.
        
        ## Compatibility 
        
        The syntax is intended to be almost identical to MediaWiki text.
        Lots of people try (or used to try, markdown is commonly used now)
        to use MediaWiki for documentation since it is/was
        well known.
        
        However if your documentation contains lots of lists and code sections
        the syntax is not altogether convenient.
        
        1. A list item has to be all on one line.
        2. There can not be any blank lines between list items.
        3. A code example can't (easily) be part of a list item.
        
        So typically you use unordered lists and it all kind of looks ok in
        the browser, even though the code examples are not really in the list
        and break the list up into multiple lists.
        
        This implementation has the following improvements.
        
        1. A list item can be split onto more than one line.
        2. If an indented block follows the list item, then it will be
        actually inside the list item.
        3. There are some alternative notations.
