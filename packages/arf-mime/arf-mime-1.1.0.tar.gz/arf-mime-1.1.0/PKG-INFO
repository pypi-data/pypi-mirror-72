Description: `arf-mime` provides simple abstract classes for representing and inspecting Abuse
        Reporting Format (ARF) messages as defined in 
        http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc5965.html
        
        ### Overview 
        There are two main classes included in this module; `ARFMessage` and 
        `FeedbackReport`.
        
        ##### ARFMessage
        Objects derived from `ARFMessage` represent a full feedback report as defined
        in [Section 2 of RFC 5965](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5965#section-2). Convenience
        methods are provided for accessing the various sub-parts of the full message.
        
        ##### FeedbackReport
        Objects derived from `FeedbackReport` represent the `message/feedback-report`
        part of the full message as defined in [Section 3 of RFC 5965](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5965#section-3). Convenience methods are provided to access the required and optional
        fields.
