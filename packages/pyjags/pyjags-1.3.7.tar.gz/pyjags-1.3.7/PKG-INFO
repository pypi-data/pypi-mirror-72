Description: 
        # PyJAGS: The Python Interface to JAGS
        PyJAGS provides a Python interface to JAGS, a program for analysis of Bayesian
        hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation.
        
        PyJAGS adds the following features on top of JAGS:
        
        * Multicore support for parallel simulation of multiple Markov chains (See Jupyter Notebook [Advanced Functionality](notebooks/Advanced%20Functionality.ipynb)
        * Saving sample MCMC chains to and restoring from HDF5 files
        * Functionality to merge samples along iterations or across chains so that sampling can be resumed in consecutive chunks until convergence criteria are satisfied
        * Connectivity to the Bayesian analysis and visualization package Arviz

        ## Supported Platforms
        PyJAGS works on MacOS and Linux. Windows is not currently supported.
        
        ## Installation
        A working JAGS installation is required.
        
        <pre>
            pip install pyjags
        </pre>
