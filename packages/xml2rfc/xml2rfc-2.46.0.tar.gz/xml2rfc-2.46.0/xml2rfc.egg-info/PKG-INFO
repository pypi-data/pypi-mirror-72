Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The IETF_ uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it
        publishes as RFCs_, and for the draft documents which are produced when
        developing documents for publications.  There exists a number of different
        tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the
        existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them.  It takes as input
        an xml file which contains the text and meta-information about author names
        etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output.  The input xml file
        should follow the grammars in RFC7749_ (for v2 documents) or RFC7991_ (for 
        v3 documents). Note that the grammar for v3 is still being refined, and 
        changes will eventually be captured in the `bis draft for 7991`_. 
        Changes not yet captured can be seen in the xml2rfc source `v3.rng`_.
        
        **xml2rfc** provides a variety of output formats. See the command line
        help for a full list of formats. It also provides conversion from v2 to
        v3, and can run the preptool_ on its input.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Installation of the python package is done as usual with 'pip install xml2rfc',
        using appropriate switches and/or sudo.
        
        Installation of support libraries for the PDF-formatter
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        In order to generate PDFs, xml2rfc uses the WeasyPrint module, which
        depends on external libaries that must be installed as native packages
        on your platform, separately from the xml2rfc install.
        
        First, install the Cairo, Pango, and GDK-PixBuf library files on your
        system.  See installation instructions on the WeasyPrint Docs:
        
            https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html
        
        (Python 3 is not needed if your system Python is 2.7, though).
        
        (On some OS X systems with System Integrity Protection active, you may
        need to create a symlink from your home directory to the library installation
        directory (often /opt/local/lib):
        
            ln -s /opt/local/lib ~/lib
        
        in order for weasyprint to find the installed cairo and pango libraries.
        Whether this is needed or not depends on whether you used macports or homebrew
        to install cairo and pango, and the homebrew / macport version.)
        
        Next, install the pycairo and weasyprint python modules using pip.
        Depending on your system, you may need to use 'sudo' or install in
        user-specific directories, using the --user switch.  On OS X in
        particular, you may also need to install a newer version of setuptools
        using --user before weasyprint can be installed.  If you install with 
        the --user switch, you may need to also set PYTHONPATH, e.g.,
        
            PYTHONPATH=/Users/henrik/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
        
        for Python 2.7.
        
        The basic pip commands (modify as needed according to the text above)
        are:
        
            pip install 'pycairo>=1.18' 'weasyprint<=0.42.3'
        
        With these installed and available to xml2rfc, the --pdf switch will be
        enabled.
        
        For PDF output, you also need to install the Noto font set.  Download the full
        set from https://noto-website-2.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/Noto-unhinted.zip,
        and install as appropriate for your platform.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        xml2rfc accepts a single XML document as input and outputs to one or more conversion formats.
        
        **Basic Usage**: ``xml2rfc SOURCE [options] FORMATS...``
        
        Run ``xml2rfc --help`` for a full listing of command-line options.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        Version 2.46.0 (23 Jun 2020)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added <dd class='break'/> and <span class='break'/> entries in
            additional places, as a workaround for WeasyPrint's eagerness to break
            between <dt> and <dd>.  Fixes issue #529.
        
          * Tweaked the rendering of <tt> inside table cells in text mode to not 
            use double quotes to distinguish the <tt> content from surrounding text 
            when the only cell content is the <tt> element.
        
          * Modified the text rendering of table cells.  <thead> and <tfoot> now 
            implies no special rendering (earlier, they caused a change in table border 
            on transition) while <th> now always renders with distinct borders compared 
            with <td>.  Also added 'light', and 'minimal' table renderings, with 
            different table border settings when compared to the previous rendering, 
            which now is available as 'full'.  The 'light' rendering is closer to the 
            v2 formatter table rendering, but does not permit table cells with colspan 
            or rowspan different from 1 to be properly distinguished.  The changes in 
            <th> rendering fixes issue #527.
        
          * Added a --table-borders option with possible values 'full', 'light', 
            'minimal', to control the table rendering of the text renderer.  The 
            current default value is 'full', but 'light' is closer to the v2 text 
            renderer's output.
        
          * Added a new internal join/indent setting to the Joiner nametuple to
            control outdenting.  Used the outdenting setting to enable outdenting
            for artwork wider than 69 characters in the v3 text renderer.  Fixes
            issue #518.
        
          * Added missing support for @indent for <ul> in the HTML renderer, and 
            tweaked the same for <ol>.  Fixes issue #528.
        
          * Corrected is_htmlblock() to not count <dt>, <dd>, and <li> as block 
            elements as they cannot be wrapped in <div>.
        
          * Updated and refined the div-wrapping used to introduce additional IDs
            to deal better with anchors on <dt>, <dd>, and <li>.  Fixes issue #530.
        
          * Made the CSS setting of background colour on <tt> and <code> more 
            selective in order not to interfere with background colour in tables, for 
            instance.
        
          * Removed CSS that made URLs in references not break across lines -- the 
            drawbacks turn out to be more of a bother than the original reason not to 
            let these wrap.
        
          * Did some HTML cleanup to make the w3.org validator happy.
        
          * Fixed a few places in the HTML renderer where an empty tag could cause 
            an exception.
        
          * Added test cases for empty and double email addresses, and added
            support for multiple email addresses within an author's address block.
            Fixes issue #522.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.45.3 (08 Jun 2020)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Fixed an issue with rendering empty <dd/> elements.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.45.2 (02 Jun 2020)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Fixed the HTML styling of <ul spacing="compact"/> lists, which wasn't 
            really compact.
