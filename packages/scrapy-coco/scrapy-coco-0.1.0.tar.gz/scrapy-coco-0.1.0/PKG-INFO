Description: ### Model manifest
        
        Model consists of following items:
        
        - name: str
        - kind: str [HTML / API]
        - pipelines: str
        - schedule: int
        - delay: int
        
        - stages: List
        - request: Dict
        - pagination: Dict
        
        
        ### Stage manifest
        
        Stage consists of following items:
        
        - selector: str
        
        - request: Dict
        - subs: List
        
        ### Request manifest
        
        Request consists of following items:
        - links: Dict / key: str
        - headers: Dict
        - cookies: Dict
        - data: Dict
        
        - method: str
        - timeout: int
        
        \* based on request manifest location. If request is used in stage definition,
        `key` is used to take value from parsed data dict. If request is used in model
        definition, links are used to make request, for ex:
        
        ```json
        {
            "request": {
                "links": {
                    "link_name1": "https://example.com/path/to/resource/1/",
                    "link_name2": "https://example.com/path/to/resource/2/"
                }
            }
        }
        ```
