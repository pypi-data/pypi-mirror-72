Description: # The Ecological Name Translator
        
        ### What is it?
        
        A lightweight python package for:
        
        - Translating ecological names in any format [e.g. at the species level (e.g. "Panthera tigris"), higher levels of taxonomy (such as genus, or family), or common name ("Tiger")] to the standardised species name equivalent.
        - Translating scientific names at any taxonomic level to the English common name equivalent
        
        ### Input & Output
        
        ##### The EcoNameTranslator (any name -> scientific name)
        
        A list of names describing species is accepted as input. This undergoes a data-cleaning procedure, after which, the following actions are taken:
        
        - Names that are already in a standard species format (that is, genus + species extension), have any spelling errors corrected
        
        - Names at higher levels of taxonomy (currently family, sub-family and genus are supported) again have any spelling mistakes corrected, and are then mapped to a list of specific species belonging to that taxonomic rank
        
        - Common names (currently, English only) are mapped to their scientific name (or all scientific names that could be described by the common English name)
        
        The output is a python dictionary which maps each item in the input list to the equivalent standard scientific name(s).
        
        ##### The ReverseTranslator (scientific name -> common English name)
        
        A list of names describing species is accepted as input. This undergoes a data-cleaning procedure, after which, the following actions are taken:
        
        - Input Scientific names have any spelling errors corrected
        
        - Names at higher levels of taxonomy are then mapped to a list of specific species belonging to that taxonomic rank
        
        - These scientific names are mapped to a list of possible common English names that describe the scientific name
        
        The output is a python dictionary which maps each scientific name in the input list to the equivalent common English name(s).
        
        ### Examples
        
        ##### Already a scientific name at the species level
        
        If correct, the name will be returned as is, and if there are any spelling mistakes, they will be corrected.
        
        ```python
        from EcoNameTranslator import EcoNameTranslator
        unstandardised_names = ['Panhera tigris'] #Should be "Panthera tigris"       
        translator = EcoNameTranslator()   
        index = translator.translate(unstandardised_names)
        print(index)
        # {'Panera tigris':['panthera tigris']}    
        ```
        
        ##### Higher levels of taxonomy
        
        If an entry in your list is at a higher taxonomic rank, all species under that rank will be returned
        
        ```python
        from EcoNameTranslator import EcoNameTranslator
        unstandardised_names = ['Panthera'] # A genus of various big cats       
        translator = EcoNameTranslator()   
        index = translator.translate(unstandardised_names)
        print(index)
        # {'Panthera': ['panthera leo', 'panthera uncia', 'panthera tigris', 'panthera onca', 'panthera pardus','panthera spec']}    
        ```
        
        ##### Common names
        
        A common name can also be provided, in which case all possible scientific names described by the common name are returned. Be careful; quite generic common names, e.g. "monkey", can return hundreds of species!
        
        ```python
        from EcoNameTranslator import EcoNameTranslator
        unstandardised_names = ['Bengal Tiger']
        translator = EcoNameTranslator()   
        index = translator.translate(unstandardised_names)
        print(index)
        # {'Bengal Tiger': ['panthera tigris']}    
        ```
        
        Note: this feature should be used with caution, as partial matching is included- that is, a list item of just "Tiger" would also bring unwanted results of things like a Tiger Beetle.
        
        ##### Reverse Translation
        
        ```python
        from EcoNameTranslator import ReverseTranslator
        unstandardised_names = ["vulpes vulpes",'ursus']
        translator = ReverseTranslator()   
        index = translator.translate(unstandardised_names)
        print(index)
        # {
        #   'vulpes vulpes': ['Red Fox','Renard Roux'],
        #   'ursus': ['Asiatic Black Bear', 'Mexican Grizzly Bear', 'American Black Bear', ...]
        # }    
        ```
        
        ##### Saving
        
        Two convenience functions are provided to save the returned python data structure to file. Simple call one of:
        
        ```python
        from EcoNameTranslator import EcoNameTranslator
        items = [...]
        index = translator.translate(items)
        translator.toPickleFile('C:/Users/...','filename') # Python serialization
        translator.toCSV('C:/Users/...','filename') # CSV 
        ```
        
        ### Why did we build it?
        
        This package was refactored as part of a larger species interaction networks project. Our project required large datasets of standardised, scientific species names; and while there is plenty of species data, the existing datasets are often incredibly messy and constructed ad-hoc- meaning assembling a standard collection of species is difficult. To help, we made this package that takes in ecological names in any format, and makes a best-effort attempt to translate the input to a standardised set of scientific names. 
        
        ### Known issues
        
        Currently, calls to APIs are made asynchronously with grequests. This library has a known issue when used in conjunction with the requests library; if you do need the requests library along the EcoNameTranslator, make sure to import requests after EcoNameTranslator:
        
        ```python
        from EcoNameTranslator import EcoNameTranslator
        import requests
        ...  
        ```
