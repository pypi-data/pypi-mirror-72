Description: # Neural Body N-Body Simulator
        
        An n-body simulator powered by a neural network.
        
        Neural Body is an n-body simulator currently as an alpha demonstration of substituting 
        calculations for planetary motion with a neural network.  Currently, the neural 
        networks can predict the position of Mars or Pluto given the rest of the positions
        in the planetary system from a simulator.
        
        The eventual goal is to replace the physics simulator that calculates the positions
        of other bodies  completely with neural networks that take in an acceleration 
        vector on each body along with a desired simulation time step and perform the 
        integration necessary to calculate the displacement of the body.
        
        Considerable time was put into training the first version of the neural network 
        which was a simple, 2 layer, feedforward neural network with 300 nodes per layer
        that performed multiple-output regression on the x, y, z coordinates of the body
        being predicted.  Input to the network was the position of every other body in the 
        system at each time step of a previously run simulation.
        
        Below is a Google Colab notebook that shows the output of a training run for the 
        neural network that predicts Mars' position.  Code that generated the training 
        data and performed preprocessing is not included.  Data file is also not included.
        The link is purely to view code, learning curves, and results.

        ## Installation
        ### Requirements
        - Compatible debian-based Linux distro.  Ubuntu 20.04 Preferred.
        - Python 3.8 or higher.
        - PyGame 2.0.0.dev10 or higher.
        - TensorFlow 2.2.0
        - Pandas 1.0.5
        - Numpy 1.19.0
        All dependencies above except for Python 3.8 should install when `pip install` is run.
        
        ### Setup
        
        Installing from .tar.gz:
        - Download `neural_body-0.1.2.tar.gz` from the `dist` directory.
        - Navigate to local folder where download is located.
        - Use `pip install neural_body-0.1.2.tar.gz`
        - Use the `neural_body` command to run the simulator from terminal.
        
        Installing from PyPi:
        - PyPi project page is located <a href="https://pypi.org/project/neural-body/" target="_blank"> here </a>
        - Use `pip install neural-body`
        - Use the `neural_body` command to run the simulator from terminal.

        ## Usage
        This selection includes an overview of all menu buttons and functionality of the simulator.
        
        ### Pause / Play
        The simulation can be paused at any point.

        ### Toggle View
        The simulation view can be toggled from overhead to side view.

        ### Adjust Speed
        The simulation can be sped up or slowed down.

        ### New Simulation
        The initial state of all bodies in the system are contained in CSV files packaged
        with the simulator.  Whichever planet is designated as the "satellite" tells the 
        simulator which neural network to use for planetary motion prediction.  This early 
        demo can only predict the motion of Mars or Pluto given the positions of the other
        planets in the system.  In later releases, the neural network will be updated to 
        accommodate predicting the motion of any body.
        
        Current Config File Options:
        - mars_sim_config.csv
        - pluto_sim_config.csv

        ### Is NASA Right?
        If you disagree with NASA, you can bring Pluto back as a planet.

        ### Show Planet Key
        Hovering over this option displays a color coded key of all planets in the system.

        ### Travel to a Day
        Selecting this option allows the user to rewind or fast forward the simulation by 
        entering the day they would like to jump to.  There is a heavy delay for fast forwarding
        as the simulator right now must inefficiently calculate every frame between the current
        day and the day you entered.  Negative time values will be treated as reverting 
        back to 0 day.
