## Installation

**Python 3.7 or higher is required**

To install the library, you can just run the following command:

```sh
# Linux/OS X
python3.7 -m pip install -U rlapi

# Windows
py -3.7 -m pip install -U rlapi
```

To install the development version, replace `rlapi` with `git+https://github.com/jack1142/rlapi`

## Usage example

You can easily create a client using the class `Client`. Here's simple example showing how you can get player stats with this library:
```py
import asyncio
import rlapi


loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

client = rlapi.Client('token')
players = loop.run_until_complete(
    client.get_player('kuxir97', rlapi.Platform.steam)
)
```
