# nrn-diff

Find differences between NEURON objects.

## Installation

    pip install nrn-diff

## Usage

```python
>>> from nrn_diff import pretty, diff
>>> from patch import p
>>> from neuron import h
>>> s1 = p.Section()
>>> s2 = h.Section()
>>> diff(s1, s2)
None
>>> s1.insert('pas')
>>> diff(s1, s2)
{"segs": [({"pas": {"e": -70, "g": 0.001, "i": 0.0}}, None)]}
>>> pretty(diff(s1, s2))
1a) Arg 1 differs in segment 0:
    * It has the mechanism 'pas' with params:
        - e: -70
        - g: 0.00
1b) Arg 2 differs in segment 0:
    * It does not have the mechanism 'pas'.
```
