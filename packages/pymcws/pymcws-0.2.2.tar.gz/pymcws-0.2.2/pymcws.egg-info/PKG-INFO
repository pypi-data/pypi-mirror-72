Description: # pyMCWS
        A python API wrapper for MCWS, the web interface of the excellent JRiver Media Center.
        The aim is to replicate the MCWS functionality as close as possible in a pythonian,
        easy to use manner. Additionally, common use-cases can be implemented in
        easily accessible recipes.
        
        Currently, the minimum required version of JRiver MC is 26. Backwards compatibility is possible,
        but will have to be requested - it is mainly the automatic field conversion that is preventing it.
        
        ## Usage
        use your package manager of choice to install pymcws:
        
        ```bash
        pipenv install pymcws
        ```
        
        First order of action is to import pymcws. You can just import the package and use
        it as a one-stop-shop-all:
        
        ```python
        import pymcws as mcws
        ```
        
        using this method, all functions and recipes are imported and available via the
        mcws object. You can then initialize a server and start using commands:
        
        ```python
        office = mcws.get_media_server("AccessKey", "readonly", "supersecretpassword")
        mcws.play_album(office, "Ludovico Einaudi", "I Giorni")
        mcws.playback_playpause(office)
        zones = mcws.playback_zones(office)
        for zone in zones:
            print(zone.index, zone.id, zone.name, zone.guid, zone.is_dlna)
        mcws.playback_playpause(office, zones[0])
        
        ```
        
        For a full set of examples, please see examples.py.

        # Version History
        
        ### v0.2.2
        * Implemented playback_loadDSPPreset based on https://github.com/kenomaerz/pymcws/issues/6.
        
        ### v0.2.1
        * Introduced session management for established media servers.
        
        ### v0.2.0
        * Added automatic field resolution. Fields are automatically converted to and from their corresponding python types by the API, sparing you the postprocessing.
        * Because of this, the required version of MC is now 26. Earlier version support is possible but needs to be requested.
        * Play recipes use more reasonable defaults for shuffle and repeat.
        * Several smaller bugfixes.
        
        
        ### v0.1.0
        * Added remote connection capabilities. The MediaServer class queries JRiver's web service and tries to determine the best possible connection method automatically.
        
        ### v0.0.7
        * Fixed zones being ignored in play_recipes.
        
        ### v0.0.6
        * Fixed failing package installation on case-aware file systems.
        
        ### v0.0.5
        * Created query recipes for easier querying.
        * Improved image and cover art handling.
        * Implemented library_values.
        * Implemented automatic query escaping for the jriver search language.
        * Play recipes allow  setting shuffle and repeat states.
        * Introduced zone handling.
        * Full automatic local ip resolution, also for multiple network adapters.
        
        ### v0.0.4
        * Support for getting file info and parsing MPLs.
        * Support for getting images for library files.
        * More lenient timeouts for local connections should prevent huge queries from failing.
        
        ### v0.0.3
        * MediaServer now throws exception if key cannot be resolved instead of failing silently.
        * Added mute, shuffle and repeat.
        * Added volume control.
        * Improved example.py to explain usage better.
        * Fixed wrong behavior of playback_stop.
        
        ### v0.0.2
        * api.py now has a method to get a server directly from pymcws object. This allows basic usage by only importing pymcws.
        
        ### v0.0.1
        * Initial release and proof of concept.
        * Resolve media network access keys.
        * Issue playback commands.
        * Search and play files to different zones on server.
        * First play_recipes that facilitate playback of files.
