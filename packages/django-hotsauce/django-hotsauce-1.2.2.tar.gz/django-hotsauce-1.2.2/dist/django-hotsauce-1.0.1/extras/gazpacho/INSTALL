Installing Gazpacho
===================

To install Gazpacho, just type:

  python setup.py install

This will install Gazpacho in the same directory as you have Python 
installed in. On most Unix systems this means /usr. However, if you
don't have write access to this directory or if you simply want to
install Gazpacho in another directory, type the following:

  python setup.py install --prefix DIRECTORY

Where DIRECTORY is the directory you want to install it to.
