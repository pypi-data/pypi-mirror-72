        ## What is it ?
        
        A Python parsing library for the IGRA v2 format.
        
        ## Key Features
        
        - parses IGRA data according to the [IGRAv2 specifications](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/igra/data/igra2-data-format.txt)
        - defines a clean Sounding data-structure easy to work with
        - streams records (don't operate the whole dataset in memory)
        - handles incoming data from standard input (default), text file and compressed file (gz/zip)
        - allows to filter soundings by providing your own function (including geoboxing)
        - outputs to JSON format and human-readable headers
        - computes statistics
        - no dependencies
        - unit-tested
