Description: # Hi-LASSO_spark
        Hi-LASSO_Spark(High-Demensinal LASSO Spark) is to improve the LASSO solutions for extremely high-dimensional data using pyspark. 
        PySpark is the Python API written in python to support Apache Spark. 
        Apache Spark is a distributed framework that can handle Big Data analysis. 
        Spark is basically a computational engine, that works with huge sets of data by processing them in parallel and batch systems.
        
        ## Installation
        **Hi-LASSO_Spark** support Python 3.6+, Additionally, you will need ``numpy``, ``scipy``, and ``glmnet``.
        
        ``Hi-LASSO_spark`` is available through PyPI and can easily be installed with a
        pip install::
        ```
        pip install hi_lasso_pyspark
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        Read the documentation on [readthedocs](https://hi-lasso-spark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
        
        ## Quick Start
        ```python
        # Data load
        import pandas as pd
        X = pd.read_csv('simulation_data_x.csv')
        y = pd.read_csv('simulation_data_y.csv')
        
        # General Usage
        from hi_lasso_pyspark.Hi_LASSO_spark import HiLASSO_Spark
        
        # Create a HiLasso model
        model = HiLASSO_Spark(X, y, q1 = 'auto', q2 = 'auto', B = 'auto', d = 0.05, alpha = 0.95)
        
        # Fit the model
        model.fit(significance_level = 0.05)
        
        # Show the coefficients
        model.coef_
        
        # Show the p-values
        model.p_values_
        
        # Show the selected variable
        model.selected_var_
        ```
