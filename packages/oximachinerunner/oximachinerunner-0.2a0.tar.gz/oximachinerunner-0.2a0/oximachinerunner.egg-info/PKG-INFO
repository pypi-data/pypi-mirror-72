        _oximachine for AiiDA lab_: Core functionalities of oximachine with stripped dependencies.
        
        _**Warning:** This model works excellent on a test set but it might give fully unphysical predictions in some cases. Consider it in alpha phase_
        
        - It is good to know where it fails
        - We work on improving the model by training it on a larger subset of the CSD with a new architecture
        
        - The featurization can be slow in some cases. In practice, it is best to get the smallest possible cell of a clean structure.
        - There is still one dependency on one of my forks of a well-known package.
        - The package is slow
        - For compatability and reproducibility we need to pin an old scikit-learn version
        
        ## features not deployed for AiIDA lab
        
        - Feature importance (slow as it has to integrate the dataset. Also, it is quite likely that we will break the API here in the future when we add new features)
        - Most similar structures in training set (is typically fast though, as it uses a KDtree)
        - Uncertainity estimate (not sure how the best way to use this in a workchain?)
        
        ## assets
        
        - `votingclassifier.joblib` is the model that is currently deployed. It is a voting classifier with four different base estimators
        - `scaler.joblib` is the standard scaler
        - `KAJZIH_freeONLY.cif` and `ACODAA.cif` are some test structures.
