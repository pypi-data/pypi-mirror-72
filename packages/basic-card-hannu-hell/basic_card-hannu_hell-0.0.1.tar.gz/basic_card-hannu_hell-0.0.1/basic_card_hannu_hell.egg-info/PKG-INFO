Description: BASIC_CARD
        
        
        This module is for anyone who is interested in creating their own card game. The functions included are self explanatory and allow to perform basic fucntions on an indidual card, deck of cards or individual hands. It uses the external pygame module to display the cards visually hence this can be used along with pygame module. It also uses the python in-built random module.
