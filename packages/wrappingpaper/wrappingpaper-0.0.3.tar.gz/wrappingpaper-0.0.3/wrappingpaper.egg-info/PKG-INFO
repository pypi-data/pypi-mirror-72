Description: # wrappingpaper
        
        A collection of Python decorators and utilities to abstract away common/tedious Python patterns.
        
        For example:
        ```python
        import wrappingpaper as wp
        
        @wp.contextdecorator
        def doing_something(a, b):
            print(a)
            yield
            print(b)
        
        # por que no los dos?
        
        # you can do this
        with doing_something(4, 5):
            print(1)
        # prints 4 1 5
        
        # as well as this
        @doing_something(4, 5)
        def something():
            print(1)
        something()
        # prints 4 1 5
        
        ```

        ## Install
        
        ```bash
        pip install wrappingpaper
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        ```python
        import wrappingpaper as wp
        ```
        
        ### Logging
        
        ```python
        import logging
        log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        
        # handle and log error
        
        @wp.log_error_as_warning(log, default=dict)
        def get_stats(x=None):
            if x is True:
                raise ValueError() # some error happens
            return {'a': 5, 'b': 6}
        
        assert get_stats() == {'a': 5, 'b': 6}
        assert get_stats(True) == {}
        ```
        
        ##### Roughly equivalent to:
        
        ```python
        def get_stats(x=None):
            try:
                if x is True:
                    raise ValueError() # some error happens
                return {'a': 5, 'b': 6}
            except ValueError as e:
                log.warning('Exception in get_stats: %s', e)
                return {}
        ```
        
        ### Context Managers
        
        Two common patterns in Python are context managers and decorators. Often, they have the same basic structure: do some initialization, run a function, and do some cleanup.
        
        And both can be useful in different contexts to give you clean code, but to use both, I often find myself writing an additional wrapper function around the context manager, and then you have to give it a slightly different name and it can get confusing.
        
        So, in comes `contextdecorator` which works the same as `contextlib.contextmanager`, but it also doubles as a function decorator. When used as a decorator, it will call the function inside the context manager.
        
        ```python
        
        @wp.contextdecorator
        def doing_something(a, b):
            print(a)
            yield
            print(b)
        
        # por que no los dos?
        
        # you can do this
        with doing_something(4, 5):
            print(1)
        
        # as well as this
        @doing_something(4, 5)
        def something():
            print(1)
        something()
        
        ```
        
        Sometimes, your decorator isn't as simple and you need to do things a bit differently in the decorator (e.g. you need the name of the wrapped function).
        
        ```python
        
        @doing_something.caller # override default decorator
        def doing_something(func, a, b): # wrapped function, decorator arguments
            # change arguments
            name = func.__name__
            a = 'calling {}: {}'.format(name, a)
            b = 'calling {}: {}'.format(name, b)
        
            # return the wrapped function
            @functools.wraps(func)
            def inner(*args, **kw):
                with doing_something(a, b):
                    return func(*args, **kw)
            return inner
        
        ```
        
        ##### Roughly equivalent to:
        
        ```python
        import functools
        from contextlib import contextmanager
        
        @contextmanager
        def doing_something(a, b):
            print(a)
            yield
            print(b)
        
        def doing_something2(a, b):
            def outer(func):
                @functools.wraps(func)
                def inner(*a, **kw):
                    with doing_something(a, b):
                        return func(*a, **kw)
                return inner
            return outer
        
        # used like:
        with doing_something(4, 5):
            print(1)
        
        @doing_something2(4, 5)
        def something():
            print(1)
        something()
        
        ```
        
        ### Properties
        
        Python property objects are incredibly useful as they allow you to create natural feeling objects with some complex stuff all bundled up in a nice unsuspecting interface.
        
        But using them, there are often times where I find myself writing the same classes stored many times over in utility files.
        
        One use-case is caching. There are different levels of caching that you can provide.
         - `cachedproperty`: cached on the instance object - runs once per instance
         - `onceproperty`: cached on the class object - runs once per class/baseclass
         - `overridable_property`: works as a normal property (calls the wrapped function), until the property is assigned to. Then it returns the assigned value.
         - `overridable_method`: works as a normal method (calls the wrapped function), until the function is called as a decorator. Then it calls the wrapped function. Works on an instance level.
        
        ```python
        import time
        
        class SomeClass:
            @wp.cachedproperty
            def instance_prop(self):
                '''This is run once per object instance.'''
                return time.time()
        
            @wp.onceproperty
            def class_prop(self):
                '''This is run once. It is cached in the property
                object itself.'''
                return time.time()
        
            @wp.overridable_property
            def overridable(self):
                return time.time()
        
            def __init__(self, overridable=None):
                if overridable: # override the property value
                    # stores at self._overridable
                    self.overridable = overridable
                # otherwise it just uses the property function like usual
        
        a = SomeClass()
        b = SomeClass()
        
        assert a.instance_prop != b.instance_prop # prop runs once per object
        assert a.class_prop == b.class_prop # prop runs only once
        assert a.overridable != a.overridable # gets called twice, shouldn't be the same
        a.overridable = 5
        assert a.overridable == 5 # now the value is overridden
        
        assert SomeClass(5).overridable == 5 # overriding inside class
        ```
        
        ### Function Signature
        
        This is something that I'm looking for constantly.
        
        Personally, I like the idea of config files that wrap up a bunch of function arguments into a file.
        
        I also hate having to duplicate arguments when passing variables down 5 levels of nested function calls.
        
        I like to just pass keyword arguments (`**kw`) down to the next function.
        
        But there are cases, where there are extra config values in your keyword dict and you only want to pass the values that your function takes.
        
        
        ```python
        # dynamic function defaults
        
        @wp.configfunction
        def asdf(a=5, b=6, c=7):
            return a + b + c
        
        assert asdf() == 5+6+7 # normal behavior
        asdf.update(a=1)
        assert asdf() == 1+6+7 # updated default
        assert asdf(3) == 3+6+7 # automatically resolves kwargs and posargs
        asdf.clear()
        assert asdf() == 5+6+7 # back to normal behavior
        
        # filter out kwargs not in the signature (if **kw, it's a no-op).
        
        @wp.filterkw
        def asdf(a=5, b=6, c=7):
            return a + b + c
        
        assert asdf(d=1234) == 5+6+7
        
        ```
        
        ## Iterables
        
        ```python
        
        # make sure that a for loop doesn't go too fast.
        # limit the time one iteration takes.
        
        # limiting the number of iterations to 10.
        # by default it loops infinitely.
        
        for dt, time_asleep in wp.limit(wp.throttled(1), 10):
            print('Iteration took {}s. Had to sleep for {}s.'.format(dt, time_asleep))
            print('-'*10)
        
        
        # check the first n items in an iterable, without removing them.
        
        it = iter(range(6))
        items, it = wp.pre_check_iter(it, 3)
        assert items == [0, 1, 2]
        assert list(it) == [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
        
        
        # repeat and chain iterables infinitely
        
        import random
        
        def get_numbers():
            return [random.random() for _ in range(10)]
        
        numbers = wp.run_iter_forever(get_numbers)
        # repeat get_numbers() and chain iterable outputs together
        all_numbers = list(wp.limit(numbers, 100))
        assert all(isinstance(x, float) for x in all_numbers)
        
        def get_numbers():
            if random.random() > 0.8: # make random breaks
                return # returns empty
            return [random.random() for _ in range(10)]
        
        numbers = wp.run_iter_forever(get_numbers, none_if_empty=True)
        # this SHOULD contain sporadic None's at a multiple of 10
        all_numbers = list(wp.limit(numbers, 5000))
        assert None in all_numbers
        ```
        
        ## Misc
        
        ```python
        import random
        
        # retry a function if an exception is raised
        
        @wp.retry_on_failure(10)
        def asdf():
            x = random.random()
            if x < 0.5:
                raise ValueError
            return x
        
        # will either return a number that is definitely > 0.5
        # or every number in the first 10 tries were below 0.5
        try:
            assert asdf() > 0.5
        except ValueError:
            print("Couldn't get a number :/")
        
        
        # ignore error
        
        with wp.ignore():
            a, b = 5, 0
            c = a / b # throws divide by zero
            a = 10 # never run
        assert a == 5
        
        
        # A wrappable alternative to `while True:`
        
        for _ in wp.infinite():
            print('this is gonna be a while...')
        
        ```
