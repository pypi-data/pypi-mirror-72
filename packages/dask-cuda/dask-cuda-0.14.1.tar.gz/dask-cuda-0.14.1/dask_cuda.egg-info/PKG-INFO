Description: Dask CUDA
        =========
        
        Various utilities to improve deployment and management of Dask workers on
        CUDA-enabled systems.
        
        This library is experimental, and its API is subject to change at any time
        without notice.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        ```python
        from dask_cuda import LocalCUDACluster
        from dask.distributed import Client
        
        cluster = LocalCUDACluster()
        client = Client(cluster)
        ```
        
        Documentation is available [here](https://dask-cuda.readthedocs.io/).
        
        What this is not
        ----------------
        
        This library does not automatically convert your Dask code to run on GPUs.
        
        It only helps with deployment and management of Dask workers in multi-GPU
        systems.  Parallelizing GPU libraries like [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai) and
        [CuPy](https://cupy.chainer.org) with Dask is an ongoing effort.  You may wish
        to read about this effort at [blog.dask.org](https://blog.dask.org) for more
        information..
