        ``config_resolver`` provides a simple, yet flexible way to provide
        configuration to your applications. It follows the `XDG Base Dir Spec
        <https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/0.8/>`_ (This instance is
        based on 0.8 of this spec) for config file locations, and adds additional ways
        to override config locations. The aims of this package are:
        
        * Provide a simple API
        * Follow well-known standards for config-file locations
        * Be as close to pure-Python as possible
        * Be framework agnostic
        * Allow custom configutaion types (``.ini`` and ``.json`` support is shipped by
          default)
        * Allow to provide system-wide defaults but allow overriding of values for more
          specific environments. These are (in increasing order of specificity):
        
          1. System-wide configuration (potentially requiring root-access to modify)
          2. User-level configuration (for all instances running as that user)
          3. Current Working Directory configuration (for a running instance)
          4. Per-Instance configuration
