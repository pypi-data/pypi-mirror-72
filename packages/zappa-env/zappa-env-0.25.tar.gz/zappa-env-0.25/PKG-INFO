Description: # Zappa Env
        
        Zappa-env is a simple package that allows you to call Zappa commands from a custom virtualenv for build purposes
        
        ## Installing & Usage
        
        Install zappa
        `pip install zappa-env`
        
        Run your Zappa commands with `zappa-env` followed by your virtualenv and Zappa command
        `zappa-env my-virtual-env zappa update prod`
        
        ## Requirements
        
        Zappa-env currently assumes that your virtualenvs are installed with the `virtualenvwrapper` package and located in `$HOME/.virtualenvs/`. Currently this is unable to be changed unless you modify the source code.
        
        ## Why?
        
        The reason I made this project was because I was getting annoyed activating a special deployment virtualenv just to deploy or package my Zappa repo. This small project combines the `workon virtualenv` and zappa commands so I can run my Zappa commands in just one line.

        Submit an issue or pull request and I'll do my best to merge the PR or help with the issue.
        
        ## To-do
        
        - [ ] Support running zappa commands with a requirements.txt file (eliminates need for virtualenvs)
        - [ ] Support Anaconda
        - [ ] Support stock Python virtualenvs
