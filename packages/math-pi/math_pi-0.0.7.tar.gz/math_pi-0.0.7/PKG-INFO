Description: # This Project has only one function: pi
        
        ## You can have **1000000(1 Million) digits** of pi in a string.
        
        You can't calculate with it, because if you convert it to foat python will reduce it to 3.141592653589793 but you can many things; make e. a [pi search](https://www.angio.net/pi/piquery.html)(To find a number sequence in pi), [create music with pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM-x3pUcdeo), [make a 3D code drawing](https://pi2e.ch/blog/2016/07/11/the-pi-protein/) or even [make a game](https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/pi)! 
        
        
        Install with pip:
        ```bash
        pip install math-pi
        ```
        
        An Example:
        ```python
        >>>import math_pi
        >>>print(math_pi.pi(b = 10))
        3.1415926535
        >>>print(math_pi.pi(a = 2, b = 10)) # This doesn't return the "3." when the starting number is more than 1
        415926535
        >>>print(math_pi.pi(b = 1000000))
        3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820... #Squuezed Output Viewer will pop up when you print a big number
        ```
        This Project requires:
        [pi_1mp](https://pypi.org/project/pi-1mp/)

        Special Thanks to [Peter Truebsen](https://pi2e.ch/blog/) who inspired me for making this module
        
        Note: ThisProject counts numbers after the point. Example ```math_pi.pi(a = 1, b = 3)``` is "3.141"
