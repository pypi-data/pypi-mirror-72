This library is covered by multiple copyrights and licenses.

The original SVD Fortran code was written by Rasmus Munk Larsen and released as
PROPACK SVD (http://soi.stanford.edu/~rmunk/PROPACK/). Teresa Laudadio and 
Diana Sima adapted it into HLSVDPRO. We are very grateful to all of them for 
sharing their work and agreeing to release it under a BSD license.

This package was originally developed as part of the Vespa - Versatile Simulation
Pulses and Analysis package at Duke University Medical Center, under the 
direction of Dr. Brian J. Soher. We subsequently moved it to a standalone 
package to make it more generally available.
