This is an example of Pwscf interface.

To create supercells with displacements:

% phonopy --pwscf -c NaCl.in -d --dim="2 2 2"

A perfect 2x2x2 supercell (supercell.in) and two 2x2x2 supercells
(supercell-xxx.in) of the conventional unit cell written in NaCl.in
are created. In addition, disp.yaml file is created. After force
calculations with the crystal structures in supercell-xxx.in, it is
needed to create FORCE_SETS file by

% phonopy --pwscf -f supercell-001.out supercell-002.out

Here .out files are the output of the Pwscf calculations and are
supposed to contain the forces on atoms calculated by Pwscf. The
disp.yaml file has to be put in the current directory. Now you can run
phonon calculation, e.g.,

% phonopy --pwscf -c NaCl.in -p band.conf
