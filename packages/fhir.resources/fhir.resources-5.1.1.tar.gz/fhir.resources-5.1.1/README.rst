All `FHIR Resources <https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html>`_ are available as python class with built-in
initial validation, exporter as json value.

* Provides ``Resource Factory`` class (see example 4) to create resource object in more convenient way.
* Previous version of FHIR® Resources are available.
* Fully support for `fhirclient <https://pypi.org/project/fhirclient/>`_ as models.
* Free software: BSD license


FHIR® Version Info
------------------

FHIR® (Release R4, version 4.0.1) is available as default. Also previous versions are available as Python sub-package
(each release name string becomes sub-package name, i.e ``STU3`` ).

**Available Previous Versions**:

* ``STU3`` (3.0.2)

* ``DSTU2`` (1.0.2)

Installation
------------

Just a simple ``pip install fhir.resources`` or ``easy_install fhir.resources`` is enough. But if you want development
version, just clone from https://github.com/nazrulworld/fhir.resources and ``python setup.py install``.


**Example: 1**: Resource object created from json string::


    >>> from fhir.resources.organization import Organization
    >>> from fhir.resources.address import Address
    >>> json_dict = {"resourceType": "Organization",
    ...     "id": "mmanu",
    ...     "active": True,
    ...     "name": "Acme Corporation",
    ...     "address": [{"country": "Swizterland"}]
    ... }
    >>> org = Organization(json_dict)
    >>> isinstance(org.address[0], Address)
    >>> True
    >>> org.address[0].country == "Swizterland"
    True
    >>> org.as_json()['active'] is True
    True


**Example: 2**: Construct resource object in python way::


    >>> org = Organization()
    >>> org.id = "mmanu"
    >>> org.active = True
    >>> org.name = "Acme Corporation"
    >>> org.address = list()
    >>> address = Address()
    >>> address.country = "Swizterland"
    >>> org.address.append(address)
    >>> org.as_json() == json_dict
    True


**Example: 3**: Auto validation while providing wrong datatype::

    >>> from fhir.resources.fhirabstractbase import FHIRValidationError
    >>> try:
    ...     org = Organization({"id": "fmk", "address": ["i am wrong type"]})
    ...     raise AssertionError("Code should not come here")
    ... except FHIRValidationError:
    ...     pass


**Example: 4**: Using Resource Factory::

    This package provides a convenient factory to create FHIR® resource, you never need to import manually each resource class.

    >>> from fhir.resources.fhirelementfactory import FHIRElementFactory
    >>> json_dict = {"resourceType": "Organization",
    ...     "id": "mmanu",
    ...     "active": True,
    ...     "name": "Acme Corporation",
    ...     "address": [{"country": "Swizterland"}]
    ... }
    >>> org = FHIRElementFactory.instantiate('Organization', json_dict)
    >>> org.address[0].country == "Swizterland"
    True
    >>> org.as_json()['active'] is True
    True

Release and Version Policy
--------------------------

Starting from  version ``5.0.0`` we are following our own release policy and we although follow Semantic Versioning scheme like FHIR® version.
Unlike previous statement (bellow), releasing now is not dependent on FHIR®.


**removed statement**

    This package is following `FHIR® release and versioning policy <https://www.hl7.org/fhir/versions.html>`_, for example say, FHIR releases next version 4.0.1,
    we also release same version here.
