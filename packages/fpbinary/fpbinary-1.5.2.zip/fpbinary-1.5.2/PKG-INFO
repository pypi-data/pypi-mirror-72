        Introduction
        ================
        
        fpbinary is a binary fixed point library for Python. It is written as an extension module for the CPython implementation of Python.
        
        fpbinary was created with **fast** simulation of math-intensive systems destined for digital hardware (e.g. signal processing) in mind. While Python has great support for signal processing functions, there is no offical fixed point library. Implementaions written completely in Python tend to be frustratingly slow, so fpbinary is an attempt to make fixed point simulation of large, complex hardware systems in Python viable.
