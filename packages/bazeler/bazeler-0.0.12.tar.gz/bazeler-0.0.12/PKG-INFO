Description: # Bazel helper
        
        Repositories are defined by the `required.json` and `provides.json` sentinel
        files in each repository. For example, in `common/Sophus`:
        
        ```
        {
          "dependencies": [
            "eigen"
          ]
        }
        ```
        
        This requires the `eigen` dependency, which means either: 
        
        * A repository exists in the parent directory that contains a `provides.json`
          file, or:
        * A buildfile exists for the given architecture (for natively installed
          libraries)
        
        This is designed to be used in conjunction with Google's git-repo:
        [git-repo](https://code.google.com/archive/p/git-repo/)
