``backports.zoneinfo``: A backport of the ``zoneinfo`` module
=============================================================

This was originally the reference implementation for :pep:`615`, which adds
support for the IANA time zone database to the Python standard library, but now
serves as a backport of the module to Python 3.6+ (including PyPy).

The upstream documentation can be found at :mod:`zoneinfo`. A mirror of the
documentation pinned to the version supported in the backport can be found at
:mod:`backports.zoneinfo`.

This is the documentation for version |version|.
