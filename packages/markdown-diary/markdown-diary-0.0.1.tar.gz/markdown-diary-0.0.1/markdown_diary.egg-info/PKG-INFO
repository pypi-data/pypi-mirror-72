        Diary file template generator, producing text files in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format.
        
        I use this personally to keep a simple monthly diary of my notes and activities. Since it just produces a series of text files, they can be stored in something like Dropbox, and synced everywhere easily.

        ## Installation
        `pip install markdown-diary`
        
        ## How to use
        
        `pip install` adds the command `md-diary` to your `/bin` PATH so you can run it directly from the command line.
        
        Run `md-diary` for help.
        
        ### For a single month
        Run `md-diary YYYY-mm` (e.g. `md-diary 2019-01`) which will create a file called `01 January.md`
        
        The format looks like:
        
        ```
        # January
        
        
        
        ## Week 1
        
        ### Tue 1
        
        
        ### Wed 2
        
        
        ### Thu 3
        
        
        ### Fri 4
        
        
        
        
        ## Week 2
        
        ### Mon 7
        
        
        ### Tue 8
        ...
        ```
        
        ### For a whole year
        
        Like above, but run `md-diary YYYY` (e.g. `md-diary 20202`) which will create the files `01 January.md`, `02 February.md`, `...` in the current directory. 
        
        ### Options
        Use the `-w` flag to output weekdays only.
        
        ## Dependencies
