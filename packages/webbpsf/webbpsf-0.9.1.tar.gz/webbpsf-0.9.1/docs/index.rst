Documentation for WebbPSF
===============================

WebbPSF is a Python package that computes simulated point spread functions (PSFs) for NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly WFIRST). WebbPSF transforms models of telescope and instrument optical state into PSFs, taking into account detector pixel scales, rotations, filter profiles, and point source spectra. It is *not* a full optical model of JWST, but rather a tool for transforming optical path difference (OPD) maps, created with some other tool, into the resulting PSFs as observed with JWST's or WFIRST's instruments.

WebbPSF has been developed by Marshall Perrin, Joseph Long, Shannon Osborne, Robel Geda, Neil Zimmerman, Marcio Melendez Hernandez, Lauren Chambers, Keira Brooks, and Anand Sivaramakrishnan, with contributions from Jarron Leisenring, Ewan Douglas, Charles Lajoie, Megan Sosey, Kathryn St.Laurent, and the developers of  the astropy-helpers template framework.

Getting Started with WebbPSF
----------------------------

.. admonition:: Quickstart Jupyter Notebook

   This documentation is complemented by an `Jupyter Notebook format quickstart tutorial <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/spacetelescope/webbpsf/blob/master/notebooks/WebbPSF_tutorial.ipynb>`_. Downloading and running that notebook is a great way to get started using WebbPSF.

.. note:: 
   *Getting help:* For help using or installing webbpsf, you can contact the STScI Help Desk, help@stsci.edu. Note that WebbPSF is included in the Astroconda  python distribution, as well as being installable via :ref:`standard Python packaging tools <installation>`.

.. admonition:: How to cite WebbPSF

    In addition to this documentation, WebbPSF is described in the following references.  Users of WebbPSF are encouraged to cite one of these.

    In particular, the 2012 SPIE paper gives a broad overview, the 2014 SPIE paper presents comparisons to instrument cryotest data, and the Technical Report document describes in more detail the relevant optical physics, explains design decisions and motivation for WebbPSF's architecture, and presents extensive validation tests demonstrating consistency between WebbPSF and other PSF simulation packages used throughout the JWST project.
