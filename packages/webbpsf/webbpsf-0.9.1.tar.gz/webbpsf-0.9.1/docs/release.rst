***************************************************
Developer Notes: Releasing a new version of WebbPSF
***************************************************

Prerequisites
=============

 * Is the `develop` build `passing on Travis? <https://travis-ci.org/spacetelescope/webbpsf>`_ with all desired release items included?

Releasing new data packages
===========================

 #. Run ``dev_utils/make-data-sdist.sh`` (details below) to make a gzipped tarred archive of the WebbPSF data
 #. If the new data package is **required** (meaning you can't run WebbPSF without it, or you can run but may get incorrect results), you must bump ``DATA_VERSION_MIN`` in ``__init__.py`` to ``(0, X, Y)``
 #. Extract the resulting data archive and check that you can run the WebbPSF tests with ``WEBBPSF_PATH`` pointing to it
 #. Copy the data archive into public web space.

     #. This now means on Box. Upload to Box in the webbpsf shared data folder. Get the Box shared file URL.
     #. Update ``docs/installation.rst`` to have that new URL and updated filename in the appropriate location.

 #. Update the shared copy on STScI Central Store:

    #. ``cd`` to ``/grp/jwst/ote`` and remove the ``webbpsf-data`` symlink
    #. Copy the archive into ``/grp/jwst/ote/`` and extract it to ``/grp/jwst/ote/webbpsf-data``
    #. Rename the folder to ``webbpsf-data-0.x.y``
    #. Create a symbolic link at ``/grp/jwst/ote/webbpsf-data`` to point to the new folder

 #. Update the URL in ``installation.rst`` under :ref:`data_install`

Details for using `make-data-sdist.sh`:
-------------------------------------

Invoke ``dev_utils/make-data-sdist.sh`` one of the following ways to make a gzipped tarred archive of the WebbPSF data suitable for distribution.

**If you are on the Institute network:** ::

   $ cd webbpsf/dev_utils/
   $ ./make-data-sdist.sh 0.X.Y
   $ cp ./webbpsf-data-0.X.Y.tar.gz /path/to/public/web/directory/

**If you're working from a local data root:** ::

   $ cd webbpsf/dev_utils/
   $ DATAROOT="/Users/you/webbpsf-data-sources/" ./make-data-sdist.sh 0.X.Y
   $ cp ./webbpsf-data-0.X.Y.tar.gz /where/ever/you/want/

Releasing new versions
======================

If you are making a release for `poppy` at the same time as a release in WebbPSF, do that first.
Update the dependency requirement to the new version of poppy, in ``webbpsf/setup.cfg``.

When you are ready, proceed with the WebbPSF release as follows:

#. Get the `develop` branch into the state that you want, including all PRs merged, updated release notes. This includes all tests passing both locally and on Travis.
#. Tag the commit with `v<version>`, being sure to sign the tag with the `-s` option.
   * ``git tag -s v<version> -m "Release v<version>"``

#. Push tag to github, on `develop`
#. On github, make a PR from `develop` to `stable` (this can be done ahead of time and left open, until all individual PRs are merged into `develop`.).
#. After verifying that PR is complete and tests pass, merge it. (Once merged, both the `stable` and `develop` branches should match).
#. Release on Github:

   #. On Github, click on "[N] Releases".
   #. Select "Draft a new release".
   #. Specify the version number, title, and brief description of the release.
   #. Press "Publish Release".

#. Release to PyPI. This should now happen automatically on Travis. This will be triggered by a Travis build of a tagged commit on the `stable` branch, so it will happen automatically on the prior step for the PR into stable.

#. Release to AstroConda, via steps below.

Releasing a new version through AstroConda
==========================================

To test that an Astroconda package builds, you will need ``conda-build``::

   $ conda install conda-build

#. Fork (if needed) and clone https://github.com/astroconda/astroconda-contrib
#. If there is a new version of POPPY available to package, edit `poppy/meta.yaml <https://github.com/astroconda/astroconda-contrib/blob/master/poppy/meta.yaml>`_ to reflect the new ``version`` and ``git_tag``.
#. If the minimum needed version of the webbpsf-data package has changed in ``webbpsf/__init__.py``, edit `webbpsf-data/meta.yaml <https://github.com/astroconda/astroconda-contrib/blob/master/webbpsf-data/meta.yaml>`_ to reflect the new ``version`` and ``url``.
#. Edit `webbpsf/meta.yaml <https://github.com/astroconda/astroconda-contrib/blob/master/webbpsf/meta.yaml>`_ to reflect the new versions of POPPY and webbpsf-data, if necessary.
#. Edit in the ``git_tag`` name from ``git tag`` in the PyPI release instructions (``v0.X.Y``).
#. Verify that you can build the package from the astroconda-contrib directory: ``conda build -c http://ssb.stsci.edu/astroconda webbpsf``
#. Commit your changes to a new branch and push to GitHub.
#. Create a pull request against ``astroconda/astroconda-contrib``.
#. Wait for SSB to build the conda packages.
#. (optional) Create a new conda environment to test the package installation following :ref:`these instructions <install-with-conda>`.


Finishing the release
=====================

 #. Email an announcement to ``webbpsf-users@maillist.stsci.edu``
