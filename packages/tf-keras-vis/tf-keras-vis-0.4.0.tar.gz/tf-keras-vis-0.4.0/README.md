tf-keras-vis is a visualization toolkit for debugging `tf.keras` models in Tensorflow2.0+.
Currently supported algorisms for visualization include:

* Activation Maximization
* Class Activation Maps
   - [GradCAM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02391v1.pdf)
   - [GradCAM++](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.11063.pdf)
* Saliency Maps
   - [Vanilla Saliency](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6034.pdf)
   - [SmoothGrad](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03825.pdf)

tf-keras-vis is designed to be ease of use, light-weight and flexible.
All visualizations have the features as follows:

* Support N-dim image inputs, that's, not only support pictures but also such as 3D images.
* Support batch-wise processing, so, be able to efficiently process multiple inputs.
* Support the model that have either multiple inputs or multiple outputs, or both.
* Support Optimizers embeded in tf.keras to process Activation maximization.


## Visualizations

### Visualize Dense Layer

### Visualize Convolutional Filer

### GradCAM

The images above are generated by `GradCAM++`.

### Saliency Map

The images above are generated by `SmoothGrad`.


## Requirements

* Python 3.5-3.8
* tensorflow>=2.0


## Installation

* PyPI

```bash
$ pip install tf-keras-vis tensorflow
```

* Docker (container that run Jupyter Notebook)

```bash
$ docker run -itd -p 8888:8888 keisen/tf-keras-vis:0.4.0
```

If you have GPU processors,

```bash
$ docker run -itd --runtime=nvidia -p 8888:8888 keisen/tf-keras-vis:0.4.0-gpu
```

> You can find other images at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/keisen/tf-keras-vis/tags).


## Usage

Please see below for details:

* [examples/attentions.ipynb](https://github.com/keisen/tf-keras-vis/blob/master/examples/attentions.ipynb)
* [examples/visualize_dense_layer.ipynb](https://github.com/keisen/tf-keras-vis/blob/master/examples/visualize_dense_layer.ipynb)
* [examples/visualize_conv_filters.ipynb](https://github.com/keisen/tf-keras-vis/blob/master/examples/visualize_conv_filters.ipynb)

**[NOTE]**
If you have ever used [keras-vis](https://github.com/raghakot/keras-vis), perhaps you may feel that tf-keras-vis is similar with keras-vis.
Yes, tf-keras-vis derived from keras-vis.
And then it was designed to support features in the description of this README such as multiple inputs/outputs, batchwise processing and so on.
Therefore, although both provided visualization algorisms are almost the same, those software architectures are different.
Please notice that tf-keras-vis APIs doesnâ€™t have compatibility with keras-vis.


## ToDo
* API documentations
* We're going to add some algorisms such as below.
   - [ScoreCAM: Score-Weighted Visual Explanations for Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01279.pdf)
   - Deep Dream
   - Style transfer


## Known Issues

* With InceptionV3, ActivationMaximization doesn't work well, that's, it might generate meanninglessly bulr image.
* With cascading model, Gradcam and Gradcam++ don't work well, that's, it might occur some error.
* Unsupport `channels-first` models and datas.
