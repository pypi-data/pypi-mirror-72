Description: "ProtoFuzz is a generic fuzzer for Googleâ€™s Protocol Buffers format.
        Instead of defining a new fuzzer generator for custom binary formats, protofuzz automatically creates a fuzzer based on
        the same format definition that programs use. ProtoFuzz is implemented as a stand-alone Python3 program.
Platform: UNKNOWN
