# Fundamental Analysis
This package collects fundamentals and detailed company stock data from a large group of companies (13.000+)
from FinancialModelingPrep and uses Yahoo Finance to obtain stock data for any financial instrument. It allows
the user to do most of the essential fundamental analysis. It also gives the possibility to quickly compare
multiple companies or do a sector analysis.

See a visualisation of the data on my
[Fundamentals Quantifier website](https://github.com/JerBouma/FundamentalsQuantifier).

With this data you can do a complete analysis of the selected company, in this case Apple. However, by looping
over a large selection of companies you are able to collect a bulk of data. Therefore, by  entering a specific sector
(for example, all tickers of the Semi-Conducter industry) you can quickly quantify the sector and look for
key performers.

To find companies belonging to a specific sector or industry, please have a look at the JSON files
[here](https://github.com/JerBouma/FundamentalsQuantifier/tree/master/data). Alternatively, you can have a 
look at the [Fundamentals Quantifier](https://fundamentals-quantifier.herokuapp.com/), a website that I have written
to visually compare any selection of companies.
