This package has been tested with Python 2.7 and 3.6.
=====================================================

The SDK is released with backwards compatibility guarantees.

Machine learning tensorboard package combines the AzureML SDK with tensorboard visualization.

It can be used to:

 * Export run history to tensorboard logs directory.  The user can run tensorboard against the directory to view metrics.
 * Launch tensorboard from run history.  Tensorflow logs can be written to a specified logs directory and then automatically loaded in real-time from azure blob storage.
