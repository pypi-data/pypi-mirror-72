Intro: [Bm] [F#7] [A] [E] [G] [D] [Em] [F#7]
{c: }
[Bm] On a dark desert highway [F#7] cool wind in my hair
[A] Warm smell of colitas [E] rising up through the air
[G] Up ahead in the distance [D] I saw a shimmering light
[Em] My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
[F#7] I had to stop for the night
{c: }
[Bm] There she stood in the doorway [F#7] I heard the mission bell
[A] And I was thinking to myself this could be [E] heaven or this could be hell
[G] Then she lit up a candle [D] and she showed me the way
[Em] There were voices down the corridor [F#7] I thought I heard them say
{c: }
[G] Welcome to the Hotel Cali[D]fornia
Such a [Em] lovely place such a [Bm] lovely face
[G] Plenty of room at the Hotel Cali[D]fornia
Any [Em] time of year you can [F#7] find it here
{c: }
[Bm] Her mind is Tiffany twisted [F#7] she got the Mercedes bends
[A] She got a lot of pretty pretty boys [E] that she calls friends
[G] How they dance in the courtyard [D] sweet summer sweat
[Em] Some dance to remember [F#7] some dance to forget
[Bm] So I called up the captain [F#7] please bring me my wine
He said [A] we haven't had that spirit here since [E] 1969
[G] And still those voices are calling from [D] far away
[Em] Wake you up in the middle of the night [F#7] just to hear them say

[G] Welcome to the Hotel Cali[D]fornia
Such a [Em] lovely place such a [Bm] lovely face
[G] Plenty of room at the Hotel Cali[D]fornia
Any [Em] time of year you can [F#7] find it here
{c: }
[Bm] Mirrors on the ceiling [F#7] the pink champagne on ice
And she said [A] we are all just prisoners here [E] of our own device
[G] And in the master's chambers [D] they gathered for the feast
[Em] They stab it with their steely knives but they [F#7] just can't kill the beast
[Bm] Last thing I remember I was [F#7] running for the door
[A] I had to find the passage back to the [E] place I was before
[G] Relax said the nightman we are [D] programmed to receive
[Em] You can check out anytime you like [F#7] but you can never leave
{c: }
