# Why develop?

1. Enhance modelling and computational complexity by moving from spreadsheets to a general-purpose programming language whose instructions can be run on a server if needed.

2. Reduced complexity to be user-friendly but capturing most of the practical aspects of modelling interest rate instruments to be market consistent and realistic.

# How is it developed?

1. This open-source library has taken reference from QuantLib, the De facto standard library for quantitative finance to maintain a clean object model and to allow for future expansibility.

2. It is both unit-tested and integration-tested.

# How to use?
```bash
pip install interestRateInstrumentsLib
```

# How to contribute?

1. Please submit pull request or contact author if a bug is found. It would be easy to follow if a test case is provided with it.

2. More instruments and tools shall be added in future. For general issues, flag them in the issues tab.
