        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.0.7 (2020-06-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed Downsample so it filters columns instead of rows.
        
        0.0.6 (2019-11-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Added tranformations based on scikit-learn: PowerTransformer, QuantileTranformer and RobustScalar.
        
        0.0.5 (2019-11-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Added Log transformation.
        - Updated to wai.common v0.0.17
        
        0.0.4 (2019-10-04)
        -------------------
        
        - Standardize now implements Serialisable interface.
        - Serialisable can now serialise strings.
        
        0.0.3 (2019-08-21)
        -------------------
        
        - Added FFT as a transformation.
        - Fixed bug in initialize(Matrix, Matrix) for YGradientEPO and OPLS where any error message wasn't being returned.
        - Removed utilities to wai.common, and import them back to here.
        - read/write in matrix.helper can now accept open file handles as well as file names.
        - Calling inverseTransform on SavitzkyGolay now raises a NotImplementedError, instead of silently passing.
        - Testing infrastructure is now imported from wai.test.
        - Added a Serialisable interface, which allows objects to write their state to a binary stream. SavitzkyGolay
          and SIMPLS implement this.
        - Added Equidistance resampling filter.
        
        0.0.2 (2019-07-25)
        -------------------
        
        - Modified RowNorm to reconfigure itself for every matrix it sees.
        
        0.0.1 (2019-07-15)
        -------------------
        
        - Initial release
