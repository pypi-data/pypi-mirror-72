    """
    Description
    ----
    Initializes the client from Stravalib (https://github.com/hozn/stravalib) by using
    Selenium. This does the following:
        - Opens up a custom browser (Selenium)
        - Browses over to the authorization url
        - Enters your log-in details you provided (username and password) and logs in
        - When log-in is successful, grabs the url and closes the browser.

    Within this url is a "token" that is used to activate your session. This makes it so that data
    can be collected.

    Note: this function requests your username and password. Note that this is merely used
    to obtain the required token to access your Strava data. Therefore, always keep this
    information private.

    Input
    ----
    username (string)
        Your Strava username which you use to log-in to Strava.
    password (string)
        Your Strava password which you use to log-in to Strava.
    client_id (string or integer)
        Your API ID which you can obtain by creating a Strava API.
    client_secret (string)
        Your API Secret which you can obtain by creating a Strava API.
    chrome_driver_path (string)
        Add your own Chrome Driver path if you already have the .exe
        file required for Selenium.

    Output
    ----
    client (object)
        Creates a client that can be used to collect athlete data from your account.
