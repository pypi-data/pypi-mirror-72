    Exports General Data to one json file. It does so by creating the folder "General Data" and placing the
    json file in it.

    Furthermore, it also adds an activities list by default to be used to be used to obtain activity ids.
    This is separated from the collect_general_data because it is only relevant

        Data obtained from the collect_general_data() function.
    general_data_name (string)

        By default this is set to "general_data.json"
    activities_list (Dictionary)

        By default this variable is set to None which means it is not exported.
    activities_data_name (string)
        Contains the name you wish to give to the activities list json file.
        Default is set to "activities_list.json"
