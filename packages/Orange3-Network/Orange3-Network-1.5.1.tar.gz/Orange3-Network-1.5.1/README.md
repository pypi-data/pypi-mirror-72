Installation
------------

Install from Orange add-on installer through Options - Add-ons.

To install the add-on with pip use

    pip install orange3-network

To install the add-on from source, run

    python setup.py install

To register this add-on with Orange, but keep the code in the development directory (do not copy it to 
Python's site-packages directory), run

    python setup.py develop

You can also run

    pip install -e .

which is sometimes preferable as you can *pip uninstall* packages later.

### Anaconda

If using Anaconda Python distribution, simply run

    pip install orange3-network

### Compiling on Windows

If you are not using Anaconda distribution, but building the add-on directly from the source code, Windows users need to compile the code.
