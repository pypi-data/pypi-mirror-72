Tools, scripts and config for use with the Postfix MTA.


* Free software: GNU General Public License v3

postscan
--------

Accepts system mail logs on standard input and provides individual details of
all e-mail messages received.  Note that this can produce a *lot* of output on
a busy system.

Makes the following assumptions:

- Postfix is your MTA
- dovecot-lda is your delivery agent
- (optional) SpamAssassin is set up

Run ``postscan --help`` for command-line options.

postresolve
-----------

Since ``sendmail -bv`` doesn't work as expected, this fakes it to show you what a
given user resolves to (e.g. by processing aliases)

tweak_clamav-milter
-------------------

This script assumes ``clamav-milter`` and SpamAssassin have been installed.

::

  tweak_clamav-milter

This will alter the configurations to suit SpamAssassin and ClamAV being
invoked at SMTP time by milters, e.g. mail filter plugins.

Then, in your Postfix ``main.cf``, set::

  smtpd_milters = unix:/spamass/spamass.sock, unix:/clamav/clamav-milter.ctl
