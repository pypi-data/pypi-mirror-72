        A JupyterLab extension for reviewing pull requests
        
        ![](gifs/demo.gif)
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        - JupyterLab 2.0+
        
        ## Usage
        
        - Open the pull request extension from the tab on the left panel
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### 1. Install the extension with the following steps
        
        ```bash
        jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/pullrequests
        pip install --upgrade jupyterlab-pullrequests
        jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab_pullrequests
        ```
        
        ### 2. Getting your access token from GitHub
        
        You can get an access token by following these steps:
        
        1.  [Verify](https://help.github.com/articles/verifying-your-email-address) your email address with GitHub.
        1.  Go to your account settings on GitHub and select "Developer Settings" from the left panel.
        1.  On the left, select "Personal access tokens"
        1.  Click the "Generate new token" button, and enter your password.
        1.  Give the token a description, and check the "**repo**" scope box.
        1.  Click "Generate token"
        1.  You should be given a string which will be your access token.
        
        Remember that this token is effectively a password for your GitHub account.
        _Do not_ share it online or check the token into version control,
        as people can use it to access all of your data on GitHub.
        
        ### 3. Setting your access token in JupyterLab Pull Requests
        
        You now need to add the credentials you got from GitHub
        to your notebook configuration file. Instructions for generating a configuration
        file can be found [here](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_overview.html#configure-nbserver).
        Once you have identified this file, add the following lines to it:
        
        ```python
        c.GitHubConfig.access_token = '<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>'
        ```
        
        where "`<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>`" is the string value you obtained above.
        
        Congrats, you did it! Launch JupyterLab and look for the Pull Request tab on the left! ðŸŽ‰
