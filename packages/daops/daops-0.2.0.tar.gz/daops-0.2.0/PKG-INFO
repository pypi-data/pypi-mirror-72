        The `daops` library (pronounced "day-ops") provides a python interface to a 
        set of operations suitable for working with climate simulation outputs. It is 
        typically used with ESGF data sets that are described in NetCDF files. `daops` 
        is unique in that it accesses a store of _fixes_ defined for data sets that are 
        irregular when compared with others in their _population_. 
        
        When a `daops` operation, such as `subset`, is requested, the library will look 
        up a database of known fixes before performing and calculations or transformations. 
        The data will be loaded and _fixed_ using the [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/) 
        library before the any actual operations are sent to its sister library 
        [clisops](https://github.com/roocs/clisops).

        ## Features
        
        The package has the following features:
         * Ability to run _data-reduction_ operations on large climate data sets.
         * Knowledge of irregularities/anomalies in some climate data sets.
         * Ability to apply _fixes_ to those data sets before operating on them. 
         This process is called _normalisation_ of the data sets.
