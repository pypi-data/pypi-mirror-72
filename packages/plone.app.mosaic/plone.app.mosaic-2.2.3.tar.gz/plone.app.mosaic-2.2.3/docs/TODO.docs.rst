TODO: some rough ideas on what else to document and how to structure everything
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* overview

  * some prose, cf. README

* getting started

  * check what is in there, maybe add some prose to describe ongoings, screenshots

* content layout

  * how to add them (Select layout)
  * manifest.cfg options
  * hide / show content layouts TTW
  * save custom layout (global/per user)
  * Manage custom layouts (delete it)

  * permissions

    * who can create / change / customize / save layouts
    * note: the mosaic editor does not have a permission checking built in,
      so best practice is to just hide actions in the menu.
      this might be a security hole...

* layouts editor (via Mosaic control panel)

  * editing layouts, manifest.cfg TTW.

    * which ones are shown?
    * where is that configured?
    * where are TTW chenges persisted? how to get them into the product on the file system?

  * columns (?)

  * configuring tiles: movable, removable, editable/readonly

  * insert tile menu

* special/dedicated tiles and options

  * html tile (also replaces image tile; or is that the rich text tile?)
  * formats for tiles

* site layouts

  * fix robot test generated screenshots (in older revision of registry.rst)

* glossary (automated with sphinx magic)
