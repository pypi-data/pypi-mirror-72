        Hey!! So you are on the Right track.
        Do not waste your time in simply writing unnecessary codes.
        Download it!!
        
        For eg: If you want to convert 50 rankine to celsius:
        Just import the module. There we have our built-in-functions.
        For this one use celstorank(50) <----- Note you need to pass the value of the base unit as parameter
        & get the converted unit as your result.
        
        However, passing a non-int or a non-float value may raise an error.
        Try avoiding such errors.
