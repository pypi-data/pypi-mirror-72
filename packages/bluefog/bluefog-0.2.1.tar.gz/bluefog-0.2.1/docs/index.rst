Bluefog is a distributed training framework for PyTorch based
on diffusion/consensus-type algorithm.
The goal of Bluefog is to make distributed and decentralized machine learning fast,
fault-tolerant, friendly to heterogeneous environment, and easy to use.

The most distinguishable feature of Bluefog compared with other popular distributed training frameworks, such as 
DistributedDataParallel provided by pytorch, Horovod, BytePS, etc., is that our core implementation rooted on the idea
that we introduce the virtual topology into the multiple processes and local averaging will converge to the global average
as iteration keep going, where local averaging is defined based on the connection in the virtual topology.

Leveraging the *One-sided Communication Ops* (i.e. remote-memory access) of MPI, Bluefog is not only distributed 
but also decentralized training framework with high performance.

* Unlike the *ring-allreduce* based Bulk Synchronous Parallel algorithm, each process in bluefog is highly decoupled so that we can maximize the power of asynchronous algorithm. 
* Unlike the *parameter-server* (PS) based architecture, there is no central node to collect and distribute information so that we can avoid the bottleneck problem existing in the PS. 

The cost of those advantages is the inconsistence between models. Please check our papers to see the theoratical guarantee.

.. Important::

   Although the most torch-based APIs perform well, this repository is still 
   in the early stage of development and more features are waiting to be implemented.
   If you are interested, you are more than welcome to join us and contribute this project!

Quick Start
-----------

First, make sure your environment is with ``python>=3.7`` and `openmpi`_ >= 4.0.
Then, install Bluefog with: ``pip install --no-cache-dir bluefog``.  Check
the :ref:`install_bluefog` page if you need more information or other install options.
We provide high-level wrapper for torch optimizer. 
Probably, the only thing you need to modify
the existing script to distributed implementation is wrapping the optimizer
with our ``DistributedBluefogOptimizer``,
then run it through ``bfrun``. That is it!

.. code-block:: python

   # Execute Python functions in parallel through
   # bfrun -np 4 python file.py

   import torch 
   import bluefog.torch as bf
   ...
   bf.init()
   optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=lr * bf.size())
   optimizer = bf.DistributedBluefogOptimizer(
      optimizer, model
   )
   ...

We also provide lots of low-level functions, which you can use those as building
blocks to construct your own distributed trainning algorithm. The following example
illustrates how to run a simple consensus algorithm through bluefog.

.. code-block:: python

   import torch
   import bluefog.torch as bf

   bf.init()
   x = torch.Tensor([bf.rank()])
   for _ in range(100):
      x = bf.neighbor_allreduce(x)
   print(f"{bf.rank()}: Average value of all ranks is {x}")

One noteable feature of Bluefog is that we leverage the One-sided Communication of MPI
to build a real decentralized and asynchronized algorithms. This is another example about
how to use Bluefog to implement an asynchronized push-sum consensus algorithm.

.. code-block:: python

   import torch
   import bluefog.torch as bf
   from bluefog.common import topology_util

   bf.init()

   # Setup the topology for communication
   bf.set_topology(topology_util.PowerTwoRingGraph(bf.size()))
   outdegree = len(bf.out_neighbor_ranks())
   indegree = len(bf.in_neighbor_ranks())

   # Create the buffer for neighbors.
   x = torch.Tensor([bf.rank(), 1.0])
   bf.win_create(x, name="x_buff", zero_init=True)

   for _ in range(100):
      bf.win_accumulate(
         x, name="x_buff",
         dst_weights={rank: 1.0 / (outdegree + 1)
                      for rank in bf.out_neighbor_ranks()},
         require_mutex=True)
      x.div_(1+outdegree)
      bf.win_update_then_collect(name="x_buff")

   bf.barrier()
   # Do not forget to sync at last!
   bf.win_update_then_collect(name="x_buff")
   print(f"{bf.rank()}: Average value of all ranks is {x[0]/x[-1]}")

Please explore our `examples`_ folder to see more about
how to implemented deep learning trainning and distributed 
optimization algorithm quickly and easily through bluefog. If you want to understand more on
how to use the low-level API as the building blocks for your own distributed
algorithm, please read our :ref:`Ops Explanation` page.
