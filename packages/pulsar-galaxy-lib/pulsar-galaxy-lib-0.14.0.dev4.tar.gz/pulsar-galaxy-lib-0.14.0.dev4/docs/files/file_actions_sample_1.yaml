# See action_mapper.py for explaination of mapper types:
# - input: Galaxy input datasets and extra files.
# - config: Galaxy config and param files.
# - tool: Files from tool's tool_dir (for now just wrapper if available).
# - workdir: Input work dir files - e.g.task-split input file.
# - metadata: Input metadata files.
# - output: Galaxy output datasets in their final home.
# - output_workdir:  Galaxy from_work_dir output paths and other files (e.g. galaxy.json)
# - output_metadata: Meta job and data files (e.g. Galaxy metadata generation files and
#                    metric instrumentation files)
# - unstructured: Other fixed tool parameter paths (likely coming from tool data, but not
#                 nessecarily). Not sure this is the best name...
