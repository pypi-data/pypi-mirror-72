**H2O4GPU** is a collection of GPU solvers by [H2Oai](https://www.h2o.ai/) with APIs in Python and R. The Python API builds upon the easy-to-use [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) API and its well-tested CPU-based algorithms.  It can be used as a drop-in replacement for scikit-learn (i.e. `import h2o4gpu as sklearn`) with support for GPUs on selected (and ever-growing) algorithms.  H2O4GPU inherits all the existing scikit-learn algorithms and falls back to CPU algorithms when the GPU algorithm does not support an important existing scikit-learn class option.  The R package is a wrapper around the H2O4GPU Python package, and the interface follows standard R conventions for modeling.
