# VerticaPy allows user to create vDataFrames (Virtual Dataframes). 
# vDataFrames simplify data exploration, data cleaning and MACHINE LEARNING     
# in VERTICA. It is an object which keeps in it all the actions that the user 
# wants to achieve and execute them when they are needed.    										
#																					
# The purpose is to bring the logic to the data and not the opposite !
