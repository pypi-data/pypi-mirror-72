# VerticaPy allows user to create Virtual Dataframe. vDataframes simplify   #
# data exploration,   data cleaning   and   machine   learning   in    Vertica.     #
# It is an object which keeps in it all the actions that the user wants to achieve  # 
# and execute them when they are needed.    										#
#																					#
# The purpose is to bring the logic to the data and not the opposite                #
