Fiddled around with ~/.pypirc quite a bit
- added tokens for testpypi and pypi
- put old wheels and src in dist-archive/

```
conda activate py38
python setup.py build sdist
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# now test the upload
cd ..
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps edflib
# if that works
pip uninstall edflib
```

now repeat for different python versions
```
cd python-edf

conda deactivate

conda activate pytorch  # currently on py37
python setup.py build bdist_wheel
conda deactivate

conda activate py36torch04c91
python setup.py build bdist_wheel
conda deactivate

conda activate py36tor04c91
python setup.py build bdist_wheel
conda deactivate

conda activate py27
python setup.py build bdist_wheel
conda deactivate
```
