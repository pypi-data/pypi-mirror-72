## Yagna Market The Yagna Market is a core component of the Yagna Network, which enables computational Offers and Demands circulation. The Market is open for all entities willing to buy computations (Demands) or monetize computational resources (Offers). ## Yagna Market API The Yagna Market API is the entry to the Yagna Market through which Requestors and Providers can publish their Demands and Offers respectively, find matching counterparty, conduct negotiations and make an agreement.
