        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        i18ndude works with Python 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, pypy and pypy3.
        Older versions are not supported anymore, use the i18ndude 4.x series
        if you need that.
        
        You can install ``i18ndude`` with Buildout or ``pip``.
        With ``pip`` you may want to look at our `requirements.txt <https://github.com/collective/i18ndude/blob/master/requirements.txt>`_.
        
        ``UnicodeEncodeError``
        ----------------------
        
        When running some ``i18ndude`` commands, you might get a ``UnicodeEncodeError``.
        This can especially happen when ``i18ndude`` prints the result and you redirect the output or pipe it.
        This is tricky, maybe impossible, to solve in ``i18ndude`` itself.
        See this related `question on stackoverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/492483/setting-the-correct-encoding-when-piping-stdout-in-python>`_.
        This question points to a solution that you yourself can do when you encounter this.
        In the (Unix-like) shell, do this::
        
            export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
        
        This fixes UnicodeEncodeErrors when piping or redirecting output that contains non-ascii.
        I (Maurits) have this line in my bash profile now.
        
        Note: if you get a ``UnicodeDecodeError``, so 'decode' instead of 'encode', then it may be something that needs fixing in ``i18ndude``.
        Please `report <https://github.com/collective/i18ndude/issues>`_ it then.
        
        Command line interface
        ======================
        
        These are the various command line options.
        
        .. ### AUTOGENERATED FROM HERE ###
        
        i18ndude
        --------
        
        ::
        
          usage: i18ndude [-h]
                          {find-untranslated,rebuild-pot,merge,sync,filter,admix,list,trmerge}
                          ...
        
          i18ndude performs various tasks related to ZPT's, Python Scripts
          and i18n.
        
          Its main task is to extract translation strings (msgids) into a
          .pot file (with the 'rebuild-pot' command), and sync the .pot file
          with .po files (with the 'sync' command).
        
          Call i18ndude with one of the listed subcommands followed by
          --help to get help for that subcommand.
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        
          subcommands:
            {find-untranslated,rebuild-pot,merge,sync,filter,admix,list,trmerge}
        
        find-untranslated
        -----------------
        
        ::
        
          usage: i18ndude find-untranslated [-h] [-s] [-n] [files [files ...]]
        
              Provide a list of ZPT filenames and I will output a report of places
              where I suspect untranslated messages, i.e. tags for which
              "i18n:translate" or "i18n:attributes" are missing.
        
              If you provide the -s option, the report will only contain a summary
              of errors and warnings for each file (or no output if there are no
              errors or warnings). If you provide the -n option, the report will
              contain only the errors for each file.
        
              You can mark tags to be ignored for this translation check by
              setting the "i18n:ignore" attribute on the tag. Same for
              attributes with "i18n:ignore-attributes". Note that i18ndude may
              be happy with this, but your template engine may fail when trying
              to render a template containing those ignore hints.  You need
              Chameleon 2.23 or higher, or the to be released zope.tal 4.1.2.
              
        
          positional arguments:
            files            list of ZPT filenames
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help       show this help message and exit
            -s, --silent     The report will only contain a summary of errors and
                             warnings for each file (or no output if there are no errors
                             or warnings).
            -n, --nosummary  The report will contain only the errors for each file.
        
        rebuild-pot
        -----------
        
        ::
        
          usage: i18ndude rebuild-pot [-h] [--wrap | --no-wrap] [--width NUMBER] -p
                                      filename [-c domain] [-m filename]
                                      [--merge2 filename]
                                      [--exclude "<ignore1> <ignore2> ..."]
                                      [path [path ...]]
        
              Given a pot-file via the --pot option you can specify one or more
              directories which including all sub-folders will be searched for
              PageTemplates (*.*pt) and Python scripts (*.*py).
        
              Make sure you have a backup copy of the original pot-file in case
              you need to fill back in ids by hand.
        
              If you specify a domain in --create I will create the pot file and
              look for messages for that domain.  Otherwise I will take the
              domain from the Domain header in the given pot file and keep the
              headers from the file as base for a new pot file.
        
              Note that in Python files we simply look for text within an underscore
              method: _("...").  We do not know which domain this is.
              If this finds text from a domain that you do not want to find,
              you should give the underscore method for the unwanted domain
              a different name, for example:
        
                from zope.i18nmessageid import MessageFactory
                PMF = MessageFactory("plone")
                PMF("...")
        
              If you give me an additional pot-file with the --merge <filename>
              option, I try to merge these msgids into the target-pot file
              afterwards. If a msgid already exists in the ones I found in the
              ZPTs, I'll warn you and ignore that msgid. I take the mime-header
              from this additional pot-file. If you provide a second pot-file via
              --merge2 <filename> I'll merge this into the first merge's result
        
              You can also provide a list of filenames (or regular expressions for
              filenames) which should not be included by using the --exclude argument,
              which takes a whitespace delimited list of files (or regular expressions
              for files).
              
        
          positional arguments:
            path
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help            show this help message and exit
            --wrap                Wrap long lines.
            --no-wrap             Do not wrap long lines. This is the default.
            --width NUMBER        Set output page width. Default is 79.
            -p filename, --pot filename
            -c domain, --create domain
            -m filename, --merge filename
            --merge2 filename
            --exclude "<ignore1> <ignore2> ..."
        
        merge
        -----
        
        ::
        
          usage: i18ndude merge [-h] [--wrap | --no-wrap] [--width NUMBER] -p filename
                                -m filename [--merge2 filename]
        
              Given a pot-file via the --pot option and a second
              pot-file with the --merge <filename> option, I try to merge
              these msgids into the target-pot file. If a msgid already
              exists, I'll warn you and ignore that msgid.
        
              If you provide a --merge2 <filename> I'll first merge this one
              in addition to the first one.
              
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help            show this help message and exit
            --wrap                Wrap long lines.
            --no-wrap             Do not wrap long lines. This is the default.
            --width NUMBER        Set output page width. Default is 79.

                               pofilename [pofilename ...]
        
              Given a pot-file with the --pot option and a list of po-files I'll
              remove from the po files those message translations of which the
              msgids are not in the pot-file and add messages that the pot-file has
              but the po-file doesn't.
              
        
          positional arguments:
            pofilename
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help            show this help message and exit
            --wrap                Wrap long lines.
            --no-wrap             Do not wrap long lines. This is the default.
            --width NUMBER        Set output page width. Default is 79.
            -p potfilename, --pot potfilename
        
        filter
        ------
        
        ::
        
          usage: i18ndude filter [-h] [--wrap | --no-wrap] [--width NUMBER] file1 file2
        
              Given two pot-files I will write a copy of file1 to stdout with all
              messages removed that are also in file2, i.e. where msgids match.
              
        
          positional arguments:
            file1
            file2
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help      show this help message and exit
            --wrap          Wrap long lines.
            --no-wrap       Do not wrap long lines. This is the default.
            --width NUMBER  Set output page width. Default is 79.

        ::
        
          usage: i18ndude admix [-h] [--wrap | --no-wrap] [--width NUMBER] file1 file2
        
              Given two po-files I will look for translated entries in file2 that
              are untranslated in file1. I add these translations (msgstrs) to
              file1. Note that this will not affect the number of entries in file1.
              The result will be on stdout.
              
        
          positional arguments:
            file1
            file2
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help      show this help message and exit
            --wrap          Wrap long lines.
            --no-wrap       Do not wrap long lines. This is the default.
            --width NUMBER  Set output page width. Default is 79.
        
        list
        ----
        
        ::
        
          usage: i18ndude list [-h] -p product [product ...] [-t] [--tiered]
        
              This will create a simple listing that displays how much of the
              combined products pot's is translated for each language. Run this
              from the directory containing the pot-files. The product name is
              normally a domain name.
        
              By default we show the languages of existing po files,
              ordered by percentage.
        
              With the --tiered option, we split the languages in three tiers or groups,
              the first two with languages that Plone was traditionally translated in,
              in a hardcoded order, followed by other languages.
              This was the default output for years.
              
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help            show this help message and exit
            -p product [product ...], --products product [product ...]
            -t, --table           Output as html table
            --tiered              Show in traditional three-tiered order

                                  file1 file2
        
              Given two po-files I will update all translations from file2 into
              file1. Missing translations are added.
        
              If a translation was fuzzy in file1, and there is a nonempty translation
              in file2, the fuzzy marker is removed.
        
              Fuzzy translations in file2 are ignored.
        
              The result will be on stdout.  If you want to update the first
              file in place, use a temporary file, something like this:
        
                i18ndude trmerge file1.po file2.po > tmp_merge && mv tmp_merge file1.po

            -h, --help          show this help message and exit
            --wrap              Wrap long lines.
            --no-wrap           Do not wrap long lines. This is the default.
            --width NUMBER      Set output page width. Default is 79.
            -i, --ignore-extra  Ignore extra messages: do not add msgids that are not in
                                the original po-file. Only update translations for
                                existing msgids.
            --no-override       Do not override translations, only add missing
                                translations.

        ------------------
        
        New features:
        
        - Add check for untranslated aria-label attributes on all elements. [janjaapdriessen]
        
        Bug fixes:
        
        - Fixed ``plone.i18n`` import.
          It was a conditional import to change the names of languages in the list, so nothing serious.
          But it always failed.
          [maurits]
        
        - In the readme, suggest ``export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`` to fix ``UnicodeEncodeErrors``.
          (Note: not ``UnicodeDecodeErrors``.)
          Fixes `issue 55 <https://github.com/collective/i18ndude/issues/55>`_.
          [maurits]
        
        
        5.1.0 (2018-03-23)
        ------------------
        
        New features:
        
        - In the ``list`` command, show only languages with existing po files,
          ordered by percentage.  A new ``--tiered`` option uses the traditional
          behavior with languages in a specific order in three tiers.
          [maurits]
        
        Bug fixes:
        
        - Sort files that we extract messages from.
          On Linux they were already sorted, but not on Mac, leading to a test failure.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fixed another possible UnicodeDecodeError in find-untranslated.
          [maurits]
        
        - ``find-untranslated`` no longer complains about attributes with chameleon syntax.
          An html tag with ``title="${context/Description}"`` is no longer
          marked as having an untranslated title tag.
          Fixes `issue 53 <https://github.com/collective/i18ndude/issues/53>`_.
          [maurits]
        
        
        5.0.2 (2018-03-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed some possible UnicodeDecodeErrors in find-untranslated.
          Fixes `issue 52 <https://github.com/collective/i18ndude/issues/52>`_.
          [maurits]
        
        
        5.0.1 (2018-03-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Create universal Python wheel.  [maurits]
        
        
        5.0.0 (2018-03-05)
        ------------------
        
        Breaking changes:
        
        - Drop support for python 2.6 and older. Retain python2.7 support.
          [gyst]
        
        New features:
        
        - Support python 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, pypy and pypy3.
          [gyst]
        
        Bug fixes:
        
        - Removed ``ordereddict`` and ```argparse`` dependencies completely.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fixed many unicode/string/bytes handling problems.
          There's probably still some unfixed that need finding, given that
          test coverage is only 63%.
          [gyst]
        
        Todo:
        
        - i18ndude/pygettext.py:159: DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib. This does not cause any breakage though.
        
        
        4.3 (2017-07-31)
        ----------------
        
        New:
        
        - Support Chameleon repeat syntax in templates.
          Fixes `issue #36 <https://github.com/collective/i18ndude/issues/36>`_.
          [maurits]
        
        - Moved ``plone.i18n`` dependency to a ``plone`` extra.
          This is only used for getting language names in the ``list`` command.
          We now fall back to using the language name that is in the ``po`` files.
          Fixes `issue #44 <https://github.com/collective/i18ndude/issues/44>`_.
          [maurits]
        
        
        4.2 (2017-06-21)
        ----------------
        
        New:
        
        - In ``find-untranslated``, do not report items that get replaced by Chameleon syntax.
          So ``<span>${view/test}</span>`` will no longer get flagged as missing a translation.
          (Note that you still *can* add ``i18n:translate`` if it makes sense,
          like Plone does for translating the dynamically calculated review state.)
          [Netroxen, maurits]
        
        - Find untranslated attributes now also checks for 'placeholder' attributes on
          input tags.
        
        4.1 (2016-12-02)
        ----------------
        
        New:
        
        - Allow use of regular expressions for --exclude parameter. For example,
          use ``*.py`` to exclude all python files. This doesn't break existing
          behavior.  Do remember to use quotes around the expression.
          [laulaz, maurits]
        
        
        4.0.1 (2015-12-03)
        ------------------
        
        Fixes:
        
        - Fixed some reported line numbers in find-untranslated.
          Fixes issue #34.
          [maurits]
        
        
        4.0.0 (2015-12-03)
        ------------------
        
        New:
        
        - Extract strings from zcml.
          Issue #28
          [maurits]
        
        - No longer print two blank lines at the end of .po and .pot files.
          [maurits]
        
        - In the find-untranslated command, first try to parse a template as
          xml, which is good for non-html files.  If that fails, try to parse
          it as html with a little help from the lxml HTMLPaser, which handles
          html5 code much better.  If that fails, use our trusty home grown
          ``common.prepare_xml`` function, which treats everything as old
          html.  Note that we still use ``xml.sax`` as the core parser here.
          Issue #15
          [maurits]
        
        - Ignore hidden files in the find-untranslated command.
          Issue #29
          [maurits]
        
        - Use lxml instead of xml.etree or elementtree for parsing
          GenericSetup xml files.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.4.5 (2015-11-05)
        ------------------
        
        New:
        
        - First try the original zope.tal parser.  Only when this fails we try
          our own parser/generator.
          [maurits]
        
        - Support Chameleon unnamed attributes without crashing.  For example:
          ``tal:attributes="python:{'data-something': 'chameleon-only'}"``
          [maurits]
        
        - Support chameleon attributes tal:switch and tal:case.
          Fixes issue #24.
          [ale-rt]
        
        
        3.4.4 (2015-11-04)
        ------------------
        
        Fixes:
        
        - Check ``tal:condition`` correctly when it is in a ``tal:something`` tag.
          [maurits]
        
        - In ``find-untranslated`` only ignore ``tal:condition="nothing"``,
          not other conditions.
          Fixes issue #16.
          [maurits]
        
        - Improved the ``prepare_xml`` function.  This tries to work around
          templates that miss the usual boiler plate, like
          ``xmlns:i18n="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/i18n"``.  But there
          were some silly errors in it.
          This refs issue #16.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.4.3 (2015-09-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix ``nosummary`` option from ``find-untranslated``.
          It was reporting wrong information.
          [gforcada]
        
        
        3.4.2 (2015-07-16)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix encoding errors with wrapAndQuoteString.
          [thet]
        
        - Pep8.
          [thet]
        
        
        3.4.1 (2015-06-25)
        ------------------
        
        - Releasing as Python wheel too.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fixed wrapping when string contains newline.
          Issue #13
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.4.0 (2014-11-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Drop Python 2.6 support.  It may still work, but the tests only run
          on Python 2.7.  Note that it is fine to use one central i18ndude
          command for all your projects, no matter what Python version they
          are using.
          [janjaapdriessen, maurits]
        
        - For the find-untranslated feature, add the possibility to mark a tag to be
          ignored by setting the "i18n:ignore" attribute on the tag. Also works for
          attributes with the "i18n:ignore-attributes" attribute.
          [janjaapdriessen]
        
        
        3.3.5 (2014-08-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Avoid AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'comments'
          when a ``.po`` file is missing an empty msgid and msgstr near the
          top.  This is fixed automatically, although it will override some
          headers.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.3.4 (2014-07-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Wrap first line correctly.  Fixes #9.
          [gforcada]
        
        
        3.3.3 (2013-11-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Package housekeeping.
          [hvelarde]
        
        
        3.3.2 (2013-11-27)
        ------------------
        
        - ``trmerge``: do not override when the mixin translation is fuzzy.
          [maurits]
        
        - ``trmerge``: add ``--no-override`` argument.  This means: do not
          override translations, only add missing translations.
          [maurits]
        
        - ``trmerge``: add ``--ignore-extra`` option.  This ignores extra msgids
          in the second po-file.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.3.1 (2013-10-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Update script.py in some cases "arguments.exclude" is None.
          [giacomos]
        
        - Fixed optional parameter exclude.
          [shylux]
        
        
        3.3.0 (2013-10-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Add command line documentation to long description of package.
          [maurits]
        
        - Add options ``--wrap``, ``--no-wrap`` and ``--width=NUMBER`` to all
          commands that write files.  Use these to determine whether long
          lines are wrapped and at which width.  Default width is 79.  By
          default we do NOT wrap, because we have never wrapped before.  This
          may change in the future, so if you *really* want to be sure to not
          wrap when using a future i18ndude version, you can add ``--no-wrap``
          now.
          https://github.com/collective/i18ndude/issues/3
          [maurits]
        
        - Fix the ``list`` command to also work in a ``locales`` structure.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fix an error in the ``merge`` command where the ``--merge`` option
          would be used as value for the ``--merge2`` option as well, if that
          option itself was unused.  This led to unneeded warnings.
          [maurits]
        
        - The ``--create domain`` option of ``rebuild-pot`` is now optional.
          If not given, i18ndude reads the domain from the given ``.pot``
          file.  It was always optional, but the documentation did not show it
          and it did not work.
          [maurits]
        
        - Update the command line options handling.  You can now get the help
          for individual commands by calling them with the ``--help`` option.
          [maurits]
        
        - Return exit code 1 when the called function gives an error.  This
          currently only has an effect when calling ``find-untranslated``.
          https://github.com/collective/i18ndude/issues/1
          [maurits]
        
        - Moved code to https://github.com/collective/i18ndude
          [maurits]
        
        - Backslash escape added to msgid when it includes double quotes.
          [taito]
        
        - Add trmerge command to merge po files. Custom tailored for transifex.
          [do3cc]
        
        
        3.2.2 (2010-12-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Encode key to utf-8 for the Merge-Warning message to avoid a
          UnicodeEncodeError.
          [mikerhodes]
        
        
        3.2.1 (2010-10-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed making POT file for DOUBLE BYTE strings on default.
          [terapyon]
        
        
        3.2 (2010-09-04)
        ----------------
        
        - Replaced internal odict implementation by the ordereddict package.
          (implementation backported from Python 2.7)
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        3.1.3 (2010-09-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Avoid UnicodeDecodeError when printing warning message in add().
          [rnix]
        
        
        3.1.2 (2010-02-14)
        ------------------
        
        - elementtree is only required for Python < 2.5.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Fixed tests (patch provided by John Trammell).
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        3.1.1 (2009-11-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Strip "src" only once in the pathname for the comments.
          Example: before it generated the following comment
          "#: archetypes.referencebrowserwidget/"
          which was not so useful. Now it generates
          "archetypes.referencebrowserwidget/src/archetypes/referencebrowserwidget/..."
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        3.1 (2009-10-31)
        ----------------
        
        - Support for explicit msgids in GSReader.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Better handling of msgid references. Keep all the references in PTReader
          and PYReader. In POWriter, normalize and sort the references, write only
          MAX_OCCUR (default is 3) references.
          You can set MAX_OCCUR=None if you want all references to be written to
          the generated POT file. Only the first reference is written in case of
          several references to the same file but with different line number.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Depend now on zope.tal 3.5.2 to print a warning when msgid already exists
          in catalog with a different default message. Simplified PTReader code.
          Check for msgid with different default in GSReader, PYReader and in the
          merged catalog (ptctl, pyctl, gsctl).
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Fix behaviour when dealing with broken xml files to be parsed.
          [afd]
        
        
        3.0 (2008-11-13)
        ----------------
        
        - No changes.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        For older changes, see ``docs/ChangeLog``.
