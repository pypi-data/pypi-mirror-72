.. MONARC Stats API documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Presentation
============

`This component <https://github.com/monarc-project/stats-service>`_ provides an API
in order to collect statistics from one or several
`MONARC <https://github.com/monarc-project/MonarcAppFO>`_ instances. It can be
deployed just next to MONARC (eventually in a virtual machine) or on a
dedicated server.

These aggregated statistics can then be sent to a central instance.
