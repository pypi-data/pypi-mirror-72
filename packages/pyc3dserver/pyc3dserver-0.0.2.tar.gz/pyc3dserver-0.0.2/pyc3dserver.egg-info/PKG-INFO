Description: # PyC3Dserver
        Python interface of C3Dserver software for reading and editing C3D motion capture files.
        
        ## Description
        PyC3Dserver is a python interace of C3Dserver using PyWin32.
        
        ## Installation
        PyC3Dserver can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyc3dserver/) using ```pip``` on Python>=3.7.
        
        ```bash
        pip install pyc3dserver
        ```
        
        ## Prerequisites
        C3Dserver x64 edition (for Windows x64 platforms) installation: https://www.c3dserver.com/
        
        ## Usage
        Most of numerical inputs and outputs using PyC3Dserver will be in the form of NumPy arrays. So it is recommended to import NumPy as well.
        ```python
        import numpy as np
        ```
        After the installation of PyC3Dserver, you can import it as follows:
        ```python
        import pyc3dserver as c3d
        ```
        You can get the COM object of C3Dserver like this. You need to use this COM object while you are working with PyC3Dserver module.
        ```python
        # Get the COM object of C3Dserver
        itf = c3d.c3dserver()
        ```
        Then, you can open a C3D file.
        ```python
        # Open a C3D file
        ret = c3d.open_c3d(itf, "sample.c3d")
        ```
        Following functions are most useful in order extract the information from a C3D file. All the outputs are python dictionary types.
        ```python
        # For the information of header
        dict_header = c3d.get_dict_header(itf)
        # For the information of all groups
        dict_groups = c3d.get_dict_groups(itf)
        # For the information of all markers(points)
        dict_markers = c3d.get_dict_markers(itf)
        # For the information of all forces/moments
        dict_forces = c3d.get_dict_forces(itf)
        # For the information of all analogs(excluding or including forces/moments)
        dict_analogs = c3d.get_dict_analogs(itf)
        ```
        After all your processes, it is recommended to close the open C3D file from C3Dserver.
        ```python
        # Close the open file from C3Dserver
        ret = c3d.close_c3d(itf)
        ```
        
        ## Examples
        There are more functions to get the information of individual markers and analogs. Also there are other functions for editing C3D files.
        You can find some examples [here](https://github.com/mkjung99/pyc3dserver_examples).
