# Testing

## How to run tests
1. Have `pytest` installed
2. be in the root of this project (NOT this directory) and run `python3 -m pytest`

NOTE: it is very important to run the above command instead of just `pytest`. You can learn the difference [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/usage.html#cmdline).
