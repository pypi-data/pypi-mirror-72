        ***************************************************************
        diff-hilite - Highlight intra-line differences in "diff" output
        ***************************************************************
        
        ``diff-hilite`` adds intra-line differences highlighting to ``diff``,
        ``git``, etc. ``diff-hilite`` is based on the excellent difflib module
        from Python standard library. The original version of the utility was
        put together by Takeshi Komiya. Last-mile patching to make it a
        drop-in replacement for ``diff`` is by Paul Sokolovsky.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        * Adds intra-line highlighting of differences to unified diff output.
        * Serves as a (pipe) filter for output of ``diff -u`` and other tools
          producing diff output in "unified" format.
        
        Install
        =======
        
        Use easy_install or pip::
        
           $ sudo easy_install diff-hilite
        
           Or
        
           $ sudo pip install diff-hilite
        
        Applying to git
        ---------------
        
        Add pager settings to your ``$HOME/.gitconfig`` to enable intra-line
        highlighting::
        
           [pager]
               log = diff-hilite | less
               show = diff-hilite | less
               diff = diff-hilite | less
        
        
        Applying to mercurial
        ---------------------
        
        Add ``color`` and ``diff_highlight`` extensions to your ``$HOME/.hgrc`` to
        enable intra-line highlighting::
        
           [extensions]
           color =
           diff_highlight =
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        * Python 2.6 or 2.7, or Python 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 or higher
          (mercurial extension works on python 2.x only).

        History
        =======
        
        2.0
        ---
        * Forked as ``diff-hilite``.
        * Don't swallow arbitrary IOError's, swallow only EPIPE which happens
          often when using with interactive pagers like ``less``.
        * Exit with the same result codes as ``diff`` (``diff | diff-hilite`` can
          be used as a drop-in replacement for just ``diff`` in scripts).
