See :ref:`the setup instructions <exercises-setup>` for details on how to install the python classes needed for the exercises.

Every :ref:`exercise <exercises-index>` comes with instructions and a demo function to get started. We recommend to create one jupyter notebook per exercise.

The following requirements should be met:

-  Either Python 2.7 or 3.4
-  `Brian2 Simulator <https://github.com/brian-team/brian2>`__ 2.0b4
-  Numpy
-  Matplotlib
-  Scipy (only required in some exercises)


If you are not using anaconda/miniconda, you can install all requirements by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt
