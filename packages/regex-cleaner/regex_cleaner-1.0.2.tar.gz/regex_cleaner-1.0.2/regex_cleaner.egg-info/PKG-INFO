Description: # Regex Cleaner
        
        This is a simple python package that can be used to clean a verbose regex pattern of the comments and new lines and return the basic underlying pattern.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        python -m pip install regex-cleaner
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        To clean a regex pattern, simply pass the verbose pattern string to the function `clean_regex`.
        
        ```python
        from regex_cleaner import clean_regex
        
        pattern = r"""
            \w\d{3} # Matches any letter followed by 3 digits.
        """
        cleaned_regex = clean_regex(pattern)
        
        print(cleaned_regex)
        ```
        
        ```bash
        \w\d{3}
        ```
        
        It should be noted that the pattern is cleaned by removing all comments from the string, then removing any whitespace left in the pattern.
        *This means that if you are using whitespace to represent space characters in your pattern they will be trimmed out.*
        
        ```python
        import regex_cleaner
        
        pattern = r"""
            \w* # Any letter repeated zero or more times.
            [. ] # Full stop followed by a space.
        """
        
        cleaned_pattern = regex_cleaner.clean_regex(pattern)
        
        print(cleaned_pattern)
        ```
        
        ```bash
        \w*[.]
        ```
        
        ## Testing
