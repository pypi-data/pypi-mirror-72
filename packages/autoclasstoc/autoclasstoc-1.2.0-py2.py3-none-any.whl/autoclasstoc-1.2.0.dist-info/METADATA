It's surprisingly difficult to document large Python classes in a way that's 
easy for users to navigate.  Most projects use the ``autodoc`` Sphinx plugin, 
which simply puts the complete documentation for each class member one after 
another.  While this does fully document the class, it doesn't give the user a 
quick way to see everything the class can do.  This makes classes of even 
moderate complexity difficult to navigate.  It also encourages projects to be 
stingy about which class members to include in the documentation (e.g.  
excluding special methods, inherited methods, private methods, and/or 
undocumented methods), to the further detriment of the user.

What's needed is for each class to have a succinct table of contents (TOC) 
that:

- Is organized into sections that will be meaningful to the user.  Different 
  projects and classes may call for different sections, e.g. public/private 
  methods, methods that share a decorator, methods with a common prefix, etc.  

- Includes every method of the class (so that the documentation is complete), 
  while still making it easy for the user to get a sense for what the class 
  does and find what they're looking for.

- Collapses inherited methods.  Complex classes in particular can inherit a lot 
  of methods from their parent classes, and while these methods should be 
  present in the TOC (since they're part of the class), collapsing them makes 
  it easier for the user to grok the functionality provided by the class 
  itself.

``autoclasstoc`` provides a new Restructured Text directive that is all of 
these things.  It also works well with ``autodoc`` and ``autogen``, and should 
be easy to incorporate into any existing project. 

See the `complete documentation`__ for more information (including examples).
