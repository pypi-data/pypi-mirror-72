Overview
========

PyChipBuilder is a Python implementation of zGlue's ChipBuilder tool. For now, the only supported functions are bring-up, debug, and testing. The package does this by using FTDI's D2XX drivers to communicate with zGlue's Smart Fabric. The installation comes with a command line interface script called ``sfabric``. zGlue Inc is distributing this library in the Python Package Index (PyPI) under zGlue Open Hardware V1 license.

Supported FTDI devices include:

* UART, GPIO and Multi-Protocol Synchronous Engine bridges:

	* FT232H (single port, clock up to 30 MHz)
	* FT2232H (dual port, clock up to 30 MHz)
	* FT4232H (quad port, clock up to 30 MHz)
