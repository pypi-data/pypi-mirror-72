PyChipBuilder Optimized OTP Programming Script

Description:
    This script optimizes OTP programming a ZIP by 
    validating the input file, minimizing required programming,
    and validating correct programming format. Replace DEV_VNP_ID and
    DEV_SN according to the FTDI device connected to your PC.
