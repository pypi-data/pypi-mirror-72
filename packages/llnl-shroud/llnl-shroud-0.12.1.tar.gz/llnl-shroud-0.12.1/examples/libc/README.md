# A Python wrapper from string.h

This library is intended to demonstrate wrapping a library using
Shroud.  All of the features in the library are already part of
Python.

```
make
```

The generated `setup.py` has some lines which are commented out that
can be used to provide the include and library paths for the library
which is being wrapped.

As an alternative, the source of the library can be added to the
`sources` list.
