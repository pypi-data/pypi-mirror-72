Function Fields
---------------

Each function can define fields to define the function
and how it should be wrapped.  These fields apply only
to a single function i.e. they are not inherited.

C_prototype
   XXX  override prototype of generated C function

cxx_template
   A list that define how each templated argument
   should be instantiated:

.. code-block:: yaml

      decl: void Function7(ArgType arg)
      cxx_template:
      - instantiation: <int>
      - instantiation: <double>

decl
   Function declaration.
   Parsed to extract function name, type and arguments descriptions.

default_arg_suffix
   A list of suffixes to apply to C and Fortran functions generated when
   wrapping a C++ function with default arguments.  The first entry is for
   the function with the fewest arguments and the final entry should be for
   all of the arguments.

format
   Format fields for the function.
   Creates scope within container (library or class).
   Described in `Format Fields`_.

fortran_generic
    A dictionary of lists that define generic functions which will be
    created.  This allows different types to be passed to the function.
    This feature is provided by C which will promote arguments.
    Each generic function will have a suffix which defaults to an underscore
    plus a sequence number.
    This change be changed by adding *function_suffix* for a declaration.

.. code-block:: yaml

      decl: void GenericReal(double arg)
      fortran_generic:
      - decl: (float arg)
        function_suffix: suffix1
      - decl: (double arg)

    A full example is at :ref:`GenericReal <example_GenericReal>`.

options
   Options fields for the function.
   Creates scope within container (library or class).
   Described in `Options`_

return_this
   If true, the method returns a reference to ``this``.  This idiom can be used
   to chain calls in C++.  This idiom does not translate to C and Fortran.
   Instead the *C_return_type* format is set to ``void``.


Options
-------

C_API_case
   Control case of *C_name_scope*.
   Possible values are 'lower' or 'upper'.
   Any other value will have no effect.

C_extern_C
   Set to *true* when the C++ routine is ``extern "C"``.
   Defaults to *false*.

C_force_wrapper
  If *true*, always create an explicit C wrapper.
  When *language* is c++ a C wrapper is always created.
  When wrapping C, the wrapper is automatically created if there is work for it to do.
  For example, pre_call or post_call is defined.
  The user should set this option when wrapping C and the function is really
  a macro or a function pointer variable. This forces a function to be created
  allowing Fortran to use the macro or function pointer.

C_line_length
  Control length of output line for generated C.
  This is not an exact line width, but is instead a hint of where
  to break lines.
  A value of 0 will give the shortest possible lines.
  Defaults to 72.

CXX_standard
  C++ standard. Defaults to *2011*.
  See *nullptr*.

debug
  Print additional comments in generated files that may 
  be useful for debugging.
  Defaults to *false*.

debug_index
  Print index number of function and relationships between 
  C and Fortran wrappers in the wrappers and json file.
  The number changes whenever a new function
  is inserted and introduces lots of meaningless differenences in the test
  answers. This option is used to avoid the clutter.  If needed for 
  debugging, then set to *true*.  **debug** must also be *true*.
  Defaults to *false*.

doxygen
  If True, create doxygen comments.

F_create_bufferify_function
  Controls creation of a *bufferify* function.
  If *true*, an additional C function is created which receives
  *bufferified* arguments - i.e. the len, len_trim, and size may be
  added as additional arguments.  Set to *false* when when you want to
  avoid passing this information.  This will avoid a copy of
  ``CHARACTER`` arguments required to append a trailing null.
  Defaults to *true*.

F_create_generic
  Controls creation of a generic interface.  It defaults to *true* for
  most cases but will be set to *False* if a function is templated on
  the return type since Fortran does not distiuguish generics based on
  return type (similar to overloaded functions based on return type in
  C++).

.. XXX should also be set to false when the templated argument in
   cxx_template is part of the implementation and not the interface.

F_line_length
  Control length of output line for generated Fortran.
  This is not an exact line width, but is instead a hint of where
  to break lines.
  A value of 0 will give the shortest possible lines.
  Defaults to 72.

F_force_wrapper
  If *true*, always create an explicit Fortran wrapper.
  If *false*, only create the wrapper when there is work for it to do;
  otherwise, call the C function directly.
  For example, a function which only deals with native
  numeric types does not need a wrapper since it can be called
  directly by defining the correct interface.
  The default is *false*.

F_standard
  The fortran standard.  Defaults to *2003*.
  This effects the ``mold`` argument of the ``allocate`` statement.

F_string_len_trim
  For each function with a ``std::string`` argument, create another C
  function which accepts a buffer and length.  The C wrapper will call
  the ``std::string`` constructor, instead of the Fortran wrapper
  creating a ``NULL`` terminated string using ``trim``.  This avoids
  copying the string in the Fortran wrapper.
  Defaults to *true*.

F_return_fortran_pointer
  Use ``c_f_pointer`` in the Fortran wrapper to return 
  a Fortran pointer instead of a ``type(C_PTR)``
  in routines which return a pointer
  It does not apply to ``char *``, ``void *``, and routines which return
  a pointer to a class instance.
  Defaults to *true*.

.. XXX how to decide length of pointer

literalinclude

  Write some text lines which can be used with Sphinx's literalinclude
  directive.  This is used to insert the generated code into the
  documentation.
  Can be applied at the top level or any declaration.
  Setting *literalinclude* at the top level implies *literalinclude2*.

literalinclude2

  Write some text lines which can be used with Sphinx's literalinclude
  directive.  Only effects some entities which do not map to a 
  declarations such as some helper functions or types.
  Only effective at the top level.

  Each Fortran interface will be encluded in its own ``interface`` block.
  This is to provide the interface context when code is added to the
  documentation.

PY_create_generic
  Controls creation of a multi-dispatch function with
  overloaded/templated functions.
  It defaults to *true* for
  most cases but will be set to *False* if a function is templated on
  the return type since Fortran does not distiuguish generics based on
  return type (similar to overloaded functions based on return type in
  C++).

.. XXX should also be set to false when the templated argument in
   cxx_template is part of the implementation and not the interface.

PY_write_helper_in_util
   When *True* helper functions will be written into the utility file
   *PY_utility_filename*. Useful when there are lots of classes since
   helper functions may be duplicated in several files.
   The value of format *PY_helper_prefix* will have *C_prefix* append
   to create names that are unique to the library.
   Defaults to *False*.
   
return_scalar_pointer
  Determines how to treat a function which returns a pointer to a scalar
  (it does not have the *dimension* or *rank* attribute).
  **scalar** return as a scalar or **pointer** to return as a pointer.
  This option does not effect the C or Fortran wrapper.
  For Python, **pointer** will return a NumPy scalar.
  Defaults to *pointer*.

.. default_attr_deref
  
.. bufferify

show_splicer_comments
    If ``true`` show comments which delineate the splicer blocks;
    else, do not show the comments.
    Only the global level option is used.

wrap_c
  If *true*, create C wrappers.
  Defaults to *true*.

wrap_fortran
  If *true*, create Fortran wrappers.
  Defaults to *true*.

wrap_python
  If *true*, create Python wrappers.
  Defaults to *false*.

wrap_lua
  If *true*, create Lua wrappers.
  Defaults to *false*.

Types Map
---------

Types describe how to handle arguments from Fortran to C to C++.  Then
how to convert return values from C++ to C to Fortran.

Since Fortran 2003 (ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004(E)) there is a standardized
way to generate procedure and derived-type declarations and global
variables which are interoperable with C (ISO/IEC 9899:1999). The
bind(C) attribute has been added to inform the compiler that a symbol
shall be interoperable with C; also, some constraints are added. Note,
however, that not all C features have a Fortran equivalent or vice
versa. For instance, neither C's unsigned integers nor C's functions
with variable number of arguments have an equivalent in
Fortran. [#f1]_


.. list from util.py class Typedef

forward
    Forward declaration.
    Defaults to *None*.

typedef
    Initialize from existing type
    Defaults to *None*.

f_return_code
    Fortran code used to call function and assign the return value.
    Defaults to *None*.

f_to_c
    Expression to convert Fortran type to C type.
    If this field is set, it will be used before f_cast.
    Defaults to *None*.



Doxygen
-------

Used to insert directives for doxygen for a function.

brief
   Brief description.

description
   Full description.

return
   Description of return value.


Patterns
--------

C_error_pattern
    Inserted after the call to the C++ function in the C wrapper.
    Format is evaluated in the context of the result argument.
    *c_var*, *c_var_len* refer to the result argument.

C_error_pattern_buf
    Inserted after the call to the C++ function in the buffer C wrapper
    for functions with string arguments.
    Format is evaluated in the context of the result argument.

PY_error_pattern
    Inserted into Python wrapper.
