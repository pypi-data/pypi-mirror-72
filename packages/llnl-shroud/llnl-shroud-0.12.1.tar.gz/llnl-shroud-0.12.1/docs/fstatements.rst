Fortran Statements
==================

.. note:: Work in progress.

Typemaps are used to add code to the generated wrappers
to replace the default code.

The statements work together to pass variables and metadata between
Fortran and C.


fc_statements
-------------

A Fortran wrapper is created out of several segments.

.. code-block:: text

      {F_subprogram} {F_name_impl}({F_arguments}){F_result_clause}
        arg_f_use
        arg_f_decl
        ! splicer begin
        declare
        pre_call
        call
        post_call
        ! splicer end
      end {F_subprogram} {F_name_impl}


..        name="f_default",
..        c_helper="",
..        c_local_var=None,

f_helper
^^^^^^^^

Blank delimited list of Fortran helper function names to add to generated
Fortran code.
These functions are defined in whelper.py.
There is no current way to add user defined helper functions.

f_module
^^^^^^^^

``USE`` statements to add to Fortran wrapper.
A dictionary of list of ``ONLY`` names:

.. code-block:: yaml

        f_module:
          iso_c_binding:
          - C_SIZE_T
   
need_wrapper
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If true, the Fortran wrapper will always be created.
This is used when an assignment is needed to do a type coercion;
for example, with logical types.

arg_name
^^^^^^^^

List of name of arguments for Fortran subprogram.
Will be formated before use to allow ``{f_var}``.

Any function result arguments will be added at the end.
Only added if *arg_decl* is also defined.

arg_decl
^^^^^^^^

List of argument or result declarations.
Usually constructed from YAML *decl* but sometimes needs to be explicit
to add Fortran attributes such as ``TARGET`` or ``POINTER``.
Added before splicer.

.. code-block:: text

        arg_decl=[
            "character, value, intent(IN) :: {f_var}",
        ],

arg_c_call
^^^^^^^^^^


declare
^^^^^^^

A list of declarations needed by *pre_call* or *post_call*.
Usually a *c_local_var* is sufficient.
Implies *need_wrapper*.
   
pre_call
^^^^^^^^

Statement to execute before call, often to coerce types when *f_cast*
cannot be used.
Implies *need_wrapper*.
   
call
^^^^

Code used to call the function.
Defaults to ``{F_result} = {F_C_call}({F_arg_c_call})``
   
post_call
^^^^^^^^^

Statement to execute after call.
Can be use to cleanup after *pre_call* or to coerce the return value.
Implies *need_wrapper*.
   
result
^^^^^^

Name of result variable.
Added as the ``RESULT`` clause of the subprogram statement.
Can be used to change a subroutine into a function.

In this example, the subroutine is converted into a function
which will return the number of items copied into the result argument.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - decl: void vector_iota_out_with_num2(std::vector<int> &arg+intent(out))
      fstatements:
        f:
          result: num
          f_module:
            iso_c_binding: ["C_LONG"]
          declare:
          -  "integer(C_LONG) :: num"
          post_call:
          -  "num = Darg%size"
