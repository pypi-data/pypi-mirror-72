    We are handed one of several things:
        - An AST that is a lambda function
        - An AST that is a pointer to a Module that wraps an AST
        - Text that contains properly formatted ast code for a lambda function.

    Returns:
        An ast starting from the Lambda AST node.

#     A python 3 AST tranformer to replace function calls in the AST that are actually LINQ operators.

#     ObjectStream has methods called Select and SelectMany. When they are called, they build up the AST tree. But they do that
#     by creating Select and SelectMany, etc., ast nodes. When we parse a lambda passed as text, that does not happen. This
