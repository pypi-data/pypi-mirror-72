Description: # smcmodel_localize
        
        Define a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) model to estimate positions of objects from sensor data
        
        ## Task list
        
        * Make all data pipes work with Localizationodel or LocalizationModelMultilateration
        * Make LocalizationModel and LocalizationModelMultilateration work directly with database connections (no data pipes)
        * Remove all references to moving_objects in names; fixed objects are anchors
        * Consistently call is measurement_value_name or measurement_value_field_name
        * Fix up data source in smcmodel so it can be used more than once
        * Make shoe sensor and tray sensor subclasses (or otherwise derivative of this module)
        * Add functionality to migrate data from current CSV files to DatabaseConnection
        * Make visualizations handle database connections directly
        * Visualization: show date and time together on x axis
        * Visualization: Add standard deviation to plots
        * Visualization: Make functions more DRY by breaking out common code
        * Replace print statements with logging
        * Get better control over shallow vs. deep copies of dataframes
        * Add ribbon for standard deviation to plotting functions?
        * Add docstrings
        * Generate documentation
