WhatsHap
========

WhatsHap is a software for phasing genomic variants using DNA sequencing
reads, also called *read-based phasing* or *haplotype assembly*. It is
especially suitable for long reads, but works also well with short reads.


Features
========

  * Very accurate results (Martin et al.,
    `WhatsHap: fast and accurate read-based phasing <https://doi.org/10.1101/085050>`_)
  * Works well with Illumina, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore and other types of reads
  * It phases SNVs, indels and even “complex” variants (such as ``TCG`` → ``AGAA``)
  * Pedigree phasing mode uses reads from related individuals (such as trios)
    to improve results and to reduce coverage requirements
    (Garg et al., `Read-Based Phasing of Related Individuals <https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw276>`_).
  * WhatsHap is easy to install
  * It is easy to use: Pass in a VCF and one or more BAM files, get out a phased VCF.
    Supports multi-sample VCFs.
  * It produces standard-compliant VCF output by default
  * If desired, get output that is compatible with ReadBackedPhasing
  * Open Source (MIT license)
