class Shutter(Instrument):
    """A generic instrument class for optical shutters.
    
    An optical shutter can be "Open" (allowing light to pass) or "Closed" (not
    allowing light through).  This generic class provides a GUI and some
    convenience methods.  You can set and (usually) check the state of the
    shutter using the property `Shutter.state` which is a string that's either
    "Open" or "Closed".  If you need a boolean answer, use `Shutter.is_open()`
    or `Shutter.is_closed`.  There's also `expose()` that opens for a number
    of seconds, and `toggle()` that changes state.
    
    # Subclassing Notes
    The minimum required subclassing effort is overriding `set_state` to open
    and close the shutter.  Overriding get_state allows you to read back the
    state of the shutter.  If you want to emulate that (i.e. keep track of
    the state of the shutter in software) subclass `ShutterWithEmulatedRead`
    and make sure you call its `__init__` method in your initialisation code.

        Closed) afterwards, even if exceptions occur.

        `NotImplementedError` (this is the default) in which case we will 
        default to closing the shutter afterwards unless `default_state` has
        been set in which case we use that.
