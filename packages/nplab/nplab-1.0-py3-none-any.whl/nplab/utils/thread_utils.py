Function decorators to help writing multi-threaded code:
    
@locked_action
@locked_action_decorator(wait_for_lock=True)

Decorating a function with the @locked_action decorator means that only one such function can be called simultaneously on a given object - it's intended to protect i/o operations and make the object thread safe.  By default, functions block until the lock is available, but the long form of the decorator allows this to be changed, so the function returns immediately if the object is locked.

@background_action

Decorating a function with @background_action means that it will happen in a thread.  Often you should lock the action to stop multiple threads conflicting.  NB that you should put the @background_action decorator *before* the @locked_action decorator, otherwise the lock won't work.  

A function running in the background returns a thread object; to find the return value, you can call t.join_and_return_result() (you may want to check if the thread has finished first with t.is_alive()).

    We use a Reentrant Lock, which means that a single thread can acquire() it
    multiple times.  This is helpful (for example if locked functions call
    other locked functions, this is OK).
    
    If wait_for_lock is false and an action is running, it returns immediately.
    This can be given as an argument to locked_action_decorator (which sets the
    default) or to the function when called (which overrides it).
