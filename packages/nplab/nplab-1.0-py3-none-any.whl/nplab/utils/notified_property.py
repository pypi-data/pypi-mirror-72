This module extends (actually reimplements sadly) Python's properties so that
they can do extra things when their values changed.  It's a super-lightweight
alternative to Traits.  Note that you must be using a new-style class for this
to work (i.e. you must inherit from object).

`DumbNotifiedProperty` instances work just like regular variables:

>>> class foo(object):
...     a = DumbNotifiedProperty()
>>>
>>> f = foo()
>>> f.a = 4
>>> f.a
4
>>> f.a=5
>>> f.a
5

They can also have default values:

>>> class foo(object):
...     b = DumbNotifiedProperty(10)
>>>
>>> f = foo()
>>> f.b
10

`NotifiedProperty` just extends the usual `property` mechanism:

>>> class foo(object):
...     a = DumbNotifiedProperty()
...     b = DumbNotifiedProperty(10)
...     @NotifiedProperty
...     def c(self):
...         return 99
...     @c.setter
...     def c(self, val):
...         print("discarding {0}".format(val))
>>>
>>> f = foo()
>>> f.c
99
>>> f.c = 10
discarding 10
>>> f.c
99

To register for notification, use register_for_property_changes

>>> def a_changed(a):
...     print("A changed to '{0}'".format(a))
>>> register_for_property_changes(f, "a", a_changed)
>>> f.a=6
A changed to '6'

If you inherit from `NotifiedPropertiesMixin` there will also be a method of
the object called `register_for_property_changes` that doesn't require the
object to be passed in.
