Description: # pyCubexR
        
        pyCubexR is a Python package for reading the [Cube4](https://www.scalasca.org/scalasca/software/cube-4.x/download.html) (.cubex) file format. Cube is used as a performance report explorer for Scalasca and Score-P. It is used as a generic tool for displaying a multi-dimensional performance space consisting of the dimensions (i) performance metric, (ii) call path, and (iii) system resource. Each dimension can be represented as a tree, where non-leaf nodes of the tree can be collapsed or expanded to achieve the desired level of granularity. The Cube4 (.cubex) data format is provided for Cube files produced with the [Score-P](https://www.vi-hps.org/projects/score-p) performance instrumentation and measurement infrastructure or the [Scalasca version 2.x](https://www.scalasca.org/scalasca/software/scalasca-2.x/download.html) trace analyzer (and other compatible tools).

        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from pycubexr import CubexParser
        
        cubex_file_path = "some/profile.cubex"
        with CubexParser(cubex_file_path) as cubex:
            for metric in cubex.get_metrics():
                metric_values = cubex.get_metric_values(metric=metric)
                cnode = cubex.get_cnode(metric_values.cnode_indices[0])
                region = cubex.get_region(cnode)
                cnode_values = metric_values.cnode_values(cnode.id)
        ```
