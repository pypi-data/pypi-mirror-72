        Ubiquerg is a utility package with a collection of helpful universally useful functions. The name means work (erg) everywhere (ubique), indicating our intention for these to be low-level functions that can be used in lots of different places. Functions are divided into groups, including:
        
        - collection
        - environment
        - files
        - paths
        - system
        - web
        - cli_tools
        
        ## Development guidelines
        
        - Ubiquerg should have no dependencies outside of standard built-in python modules. Please do not add any functions that introduce a new dependency.
        - Functions should be generic. They should perform basic, low-level processing that is not specific to a particular application.
        - Functions should only be added to ubiquerg if they are used in at least 2 existing modules.
        - Functions should be kept relatively small and simple (ideally <50 lines of code).
