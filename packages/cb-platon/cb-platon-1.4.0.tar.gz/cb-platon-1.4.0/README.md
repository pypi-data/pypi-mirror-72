## Description
**TL;DR**
Platon detects plasmid contigs within bacterial draft genomes from WGS short-read assemblies.
Therefore, Platon analyzes the natural distribution biases of certain protein coding genes between
chromosomes and plasmids. This analysis is complemented by comprehensive contig characterizations
upon which several heuristics are applied.

Platon conducts three analysis steps:
1. It predicts and searches coding sequences against a custom and pre-computed
database comprising marker protein sequences (**MPS**) and related replicon
distribution scores (**RDS**). These scores express the empirically measured
frequency biases of protein sequence distributions between plasmids and chromosomes
pre-computed on complete NCBI RefSeq replicons. Platon calculates the mean RDS for
each contig and either classifies them as chromosome if the RDS is below a
sensitivity cutoff determined to 95% sensitivity or as plasmid if the RDS is
above a specificity cutoff determined to 99.9% specificity.
Exact values for these thresholds have been computed based on Monte Carlo simulations of
artifical replicon fragments created from complete RefSeq chromosome and plasmid sequences.
2. Contigs passing the sensitivity filter get comprehensivley characterized.
Hereby, Platon tries to circularize the contig sequences, searches for rRNA,
replication, mobilization and conjugation genes, oriT sequences, incompatibility group
DNA probes and finally performs a BLAST+ search against the NCBI plasmid database.
3. Finally, to increase the overall sensitivity, Platon classifies all remaining contigs based on the gathered information
by several heuristics.

## Input/Output

### Input
Platon accepts draft assemblies in fasta format. If contigs have been assembled with
SPAdes, Platon is able to extract the coverage information from the contig names.

### Output
For each contig classified as plasmid sequence the following columns are printed
to `STDOUT` as tab separated values:
-   Contig ID
-   Length
-   Coverage
-   \# ORFs
-   RDS
-   Circularity
-   Incompatibility Type(s)
-   \# Replication Genes
-   \# Mobilization Genes
-   \# OriT Sequences
-   \# Conjugation Genes
-   \# rRNA Genes
-   \# Plasmid Database Hits

In addition, Platon writes the following files into the output directory:
-   `<prefix>`.plasmid.fasta: contigs classified as plasmids or plasmodal origin
-   `<prefix>`.chromosome.fasta: contigs classified as chromosomal origin
-   `<prefix>`.tsv: dense information as printed to STDOUT (see above)
-   `<prefix>`.json: comprehensive results and information on each single plasmid contig.
All files are prefixed (`<prefix>`) as the input genome fasta file.

## Installation
Platon can be installed in 2 different ways, though we advise to use Conda/BioConda.

In all cases, the custom database must be downloaded which we provide for download:
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3349651.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3349651)

### BioConda
1.  install Platon via [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html) and the [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) channel
2.  download & extract the database

Example:
```
$ conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c defaults platon
$ wget https://zenodo.org/record/3751774/files/db.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf db.tar.gz
$ rm db.tar.gz
$ platon --db ./db genome.fasta
```

### GitHub/Pip
1.  clone the the repository
2.  install Platon & Python dependencies per pip
3.  download & extract the database

Example:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:oschwengers/platon.git
$ cd platon
$ python3 -m pip install .
$ cd ..
$ wget https://zenodo.org/record/3751774/files/db.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf db.tar.gz
$ rm db.tar.gz
$ platon/bin/platon --db ./db genome.fasta
```

Info: Just move the extracted database directory into the platon directory.
Platon will automatically recognise it and thus, the database path doesn't need
to be specified:
```
$ ...
$ mv db/ platon
$ platon/bin/platon genome.fasta
```

## Usage
Usage:
```

                        sensitivity); specificity: RDS only (>=99.9%
                        specificity); accuracy: RDS & characterization

```

## Examples
Simple:
```
$ platon genome.fasta
```

Expert: writing results to `results` directory with verbose output using 8 threads:
```
$ platon -db ~/db --output results/ --verbose --threads 8 genome.fasta
```

## Mode
Platon provides 3 different modi controlling which filters will be used.
`Accuracy` mode is the preset default.

### Sensitivity
In the `sensitivity` mode Platon will classifiy all contigs with an `RDS` value *below*
the sensitivity threshold as chromosomal and all remaining contigs as plasmid.
This threshold was defined to account for 95% sensitivity and computed via Monte Carlo
simulations of artifical contigs resulting in an RDS=-7.7.
-> use this mode to *exclude chromosomal* contigs.

### Specificity
In the `specificity` mode Platon will classifiy all contigs with an `RDS` value *above*
the specificity threshold as plasmid and all remaining contigs as chromosomal.
This threshold was defined to account for 99.9% specificity and computed via Monte Carlo
simulations of artifical contigs resulting in an RDS=0.4.

### Accuracy (default)
In the `accuracy` mode Platon will classifiy all contigs with:
  - an `RDS` value *below* the sensitivity threshold as chromosomal
  - an `RDS` value *above* the specificity threshold as plasmid
and in addition all contigs as plasmid for which one of the following is true: it
  - can be circularized
  - has an incompatibility group sequence
  - has a replication or mobilization HMM hit
  - has an oriT hit
  - has an RDS above the conservative score (0.1), a RefSeq plasmid hit and *no* rRNA hit
