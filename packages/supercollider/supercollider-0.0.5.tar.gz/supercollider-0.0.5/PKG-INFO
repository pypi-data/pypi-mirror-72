Description: # Python client for SuperCollider
        
        A lightweight Python module to control the [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io) audio synthesis engine.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The `liblo` library is required for the underlying OSC communications.
        
        ```
        brew install liblo               # macOS
        apt-get install liblo7 liblo-dev # Linux
        ```
        
        Install the Python package:
        
        ```python
        pip3 install supercollider
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Before using the library, start the SuperCollider server, either through the SuperCollider GUI or with `scsynth -u 57110`.
        
        Within the SC client, create the below SynthDef:
        
        ```
        SynthDef(\sine, { |out = 0, freq = 440.0, gain = 0.0|
            Out.ar(out, SinOsc.ar(freq) * gain.dbamp);
        }).store;
        ```
        
        From Python, you can now create and trigger Synths:
        
        ```python
        from supercollider import Server, Synth
        
        server = Server()
        
        synth = Synth(server, "sine", { "freq" : 440.0, "gain" : -12.0 })
        synth.set("freq", 880.0)
        ```
