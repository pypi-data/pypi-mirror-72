Description: A drop-in replacement for the re module.
        
        It uses RE2 under the hood, of course, so various PCRE features
        (e.g. backreferences, look-around assertions) are not supported.
        
        Known differences between this API and the re module's API:
        
          * The error class does not provide any error information as attributes.
          * The Options class replaces the re module's flags with RE2's options as
            gettable/settable properties. Please see re2.h for their documentation.
          * The pattern string and the input string do not have to be the same type.
            Any Text (unicode in Python 2, str in Python 3) will be encoded to UTF-8.
          * The pattern string cannot be Text if the options specify Latin-1 encoding.
        
        Known issues with regard to building the C++ extension:
        
          * Building requires RE2 to be installed on your system.
            On Debian, for example, install the libre2-dev package.
          * Building requires pybind11 to be installed on your system OR venv.
            On Debian, for example, install the pybind11-dev package.
            For a venv, install the pybind11 package from PyPI.
          * Building on macOS has not been tested yet and will possibly fail.
          * Building on Windows has not been tested yet and will probably fail.
