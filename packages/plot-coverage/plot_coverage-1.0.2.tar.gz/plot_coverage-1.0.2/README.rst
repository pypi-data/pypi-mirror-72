Python package to generate plots from coverage report


Generate visual plots to demonstrate your code coverage. Interactive plots are opened in the browser immediately
after running the script. HTML files for the plots are stored alongside the coverage report inside `htmlcov` folder.

Plots are generated using plotly express.


Usage
------
* Install using `pip install plot-coverage`
* From the project root (where htmlcov folder is located), run:
        - `plot_coverage --plot=treemap`
        - `plot_coverage --plot=sunburst`

Note: Make sure htmlcov/index.html is present at the root of your project before running the above. So, `coverage html`
should be run before attempting this. 

Example
-------

Treemap
