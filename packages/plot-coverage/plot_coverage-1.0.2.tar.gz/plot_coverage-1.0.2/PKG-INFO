        Python package to generate plots from coverage report
        
        
        Generate visual plots to demonstrate your code coverage. Interactive plots are opened in the browser immediately
        after running the script. HTML files for the plots are stored alongside the coverage report inside `htmlcov` folder.
        
        Plots are generated using plotly express.
        
        
        Usage
        ------
        * Install using `pip install plot-coverage`
        * From the project root (where htmlcov folder is located), run:
                - `plot_coverage --plot=treemap`
                - `plot_coverage --plot=sunburst`
        
        Note: Make sure htmlcov/index.html is present at the root of your project before running the above. So, `coverage html`
        should be run before attempting this. 
        
        Example
        -------
        
        Treemap
        ========
        .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modasserbillah/plot_coverage/master/treemap.png
           :alt: Treemap of coverage report
           :class: with-shadow
           :scale: 50
        
        Sunburst
        =========
        .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modasserbillah/plot_coverage/master/sunburst.png
           :alt: Sunburst of coverage report
           :class: with-shadow
           :scale: 50
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Generate Treemap plot for showing your coverage report with color sequence based on coverage percentage.
        * Generate Sunburst plot for showing your coverage report with color sequence based on coverage percentage.
