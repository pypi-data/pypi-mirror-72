The AEA framework consists of several core elements, some which are required to run an AEA and others which are optional.

## The advanced elements AEAs use

In <a href="../core-components-1/">Core Components - Part 1</a> we discussed the elements each AEA uses. We will now look at some of the advanced elements each AEA uses.

### Decision Maker

The `DecisionMaker` can be thought off like a wallet manager plus "economic brain" of the AEA. It is responsible for the AEA's crypto-economic security and goal management, and it contains the preference and ownership representation of the AEA. The decision maker is the only component which has access to the wallet's private keys.

You can learn more about the decision maker <a href="../decision-maker/">here</a>.

### Wallet

The wallet contains the private-public key pairs used by the AEA.

### Identity

The identity is an abstraction that represents the identity of an AEA in the Open Economic Framework, backed by public-key cryptography. It contains the AEA's addresses as well as its name.

The identity can be accessed in a skill via the <a href="../api/context/base/">agent context</a>.

## Optional elements AEAs use

### Ledger APIs

<!-- 
Ledger APIs are special types of connections. In particular, they must implement a protocol compatible 
 -->

AEAs use Ledger APIs to communicate with public ledgers.

### Contracts

Contracts wrap smart contracts for third-party decentralized ledgers. In particular, they provide wrappers around the API or ABI of a smart contract.

Contracts can be added as packages.

<!-- ## Filter

`Filter` routes messages to the correct `Handler` via `Resource`. It also holds a reference to the currently active `Behaviour` and `Task` instances.

By default for every skill, each `Handler`, `Behaviour` and `Task` is registered in the `Filter`. However, note that skills can de-active and re-activate themselves.

The `Filter` also routes internal messages from the `DecisionMaker` to the respective `Handler` in the skills.

## Resource 

The `Resource` component is made up of `Registries` for each type of resource (e.g. `Protocol`, `Handler`, `Behaviour`, `Task`). 

Message Envelopes travel through the `Filter` which in turn fetches the correct `Handler` from the `Registry`.

Specific `Registry` classes are in the `registries/base.py` module.

* `ProtocolRegistry`.
* `HandlerRegistry`. 
* `BehaviourRegistry`.
* `TaskRegistry`.
