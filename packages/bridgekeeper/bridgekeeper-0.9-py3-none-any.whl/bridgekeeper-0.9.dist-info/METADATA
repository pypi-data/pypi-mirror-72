Bridgekeeper
------------

..

    | Who would cross the Bridge of Death
    | must answer me these questions three,
    | ere the other side he see.

    -- The Bridgekeeper, *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*

Bridgekeeper is a permissions library for Django_ projects, where permissions are defined in your code, rather than in your database.

It's heavily inspired by django-rules_, but with one important difference: **it works on QuerySets as well as individual model instances**.

This means that you can efficiently show a list of all of the model instances that your user is allowed to edit, for instance, without having your permission-checking code in two different places.

Bridgekeeper is tested on Django 2.2 and 3.0 on all Python versions Django supports, and is licensed under the MIT License.
