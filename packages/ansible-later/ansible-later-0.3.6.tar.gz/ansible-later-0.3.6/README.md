This is a fork of Will Thames [ansible-review](https://github.com/willthames/ansible-review) so credits goes to him for his work on ansible-review and ansible-lint.

_ansible-later_ is a best practice scanner and linting tool. In most cases, if you write Ansible roles in a team, it helps to have a coding or best practice guideline in place. This will make Ansible roles more readable for all maintainers and can reduce the troubleshooting time.

_ansible-later_ does __not__ ensure that your role will work as expected. For Deployment test you can use other tools like [molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule).
