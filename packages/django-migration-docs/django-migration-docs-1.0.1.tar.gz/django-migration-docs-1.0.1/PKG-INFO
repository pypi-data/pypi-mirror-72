#####################

Migrations can be one of the most challenging aspects of deploying a
Django application at scale. Depending on the size of tables and flavor
of database, some migrations can easily lock some of the most important
tables and bring down an application if more scrutiny isn't applied towards
deployed migrations. Along with this, sometimes we must document more
critical metadata about a migration before it is even deployed, such as
when the migration should run in the deployment process.

``django-migration-docs`` provides the ability to collect more structured
information about every migration in your Django project. Along with this,
it also automatically collects important metadata about migrations like
the raw SQL so that more information is available for reviewers and maintainers
of a large project.

When ``django-migration-docs`` is installed, users will be prompted for
more information about migrations using
a completely customizable schema that can be linted in continuous integration.
The default prompt looks like the following:
