Description: Munter.py
        =========
        
        Helps you speed up your tour and trip planning.
        
        Disclaimer
        ----------
        
        The time calculations produced by this program are not guaranteed to be
        accurate. Any harm or hazard encountered due to blindly trusting these
        estimates is your own fault.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        If you use pip, then simply `pip install munter.py`.
        
        If you don't use pip, then download the source code and unpack it into
        its own directory. You can invoke it directly via `python munter.py
        [options]`.
        
        How to use it
        -------------
        
        For detailed information, see:
        
        `./munter.py --help`
        
        The program supports both imperial and metric, and has four "travel
        modes" at this time: uphill, flat, downhill, bushwhacking. It also
        supports a simple fitness modifier: slow, average, fast.
        
        By default, the output will be the time in hours and minutes of the
        specified leg. If you prefer, you can use the `-p` switch to get a
        "prettier" output.
        
        ### Use as a library
        
        You can also use Munter.py programmatically from Python, like so:
        
        `import munter`  
        `est = munter.time_calc(distance=3.2, elevation=2300, fitness='slow')`
        
        This will store a value like "3.64914" in the `est` variable.
        
        Workflow
        --------
        
        My workflow involves planning my tour using tools like ArcGIS or CalTopo. Then,
        I take the stats between each leg (distance, vertical gain/loss) of the tour
        and run them through Munter.py and record its output to my field
        notebook.
        
        The rudimentary "GUI" can be directly transferred to e.g. the format used by
        SnowPit Technologies' "Avalanche Field Notebook" or your own personal format
        (e.g. RitR No. 471).
        
        Future plans
        ------------
        
        * GTK mode
        * Use as a Python library from within another project
        * Lint it (e.g. therapist)
        * Sphinx/autodoc?
