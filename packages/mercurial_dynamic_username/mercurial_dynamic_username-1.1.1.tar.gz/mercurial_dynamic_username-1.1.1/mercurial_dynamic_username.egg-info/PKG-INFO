        ====================================
        Mercurial Dynamic Username
        ====================================
        
        Use different commit username per directory tree.
        
        With this extension you may commit as ``John Smith
        <john.smith@serious.com>`` in repositories below ``~/work``, and as ``Johny
        <fastjohny@fantasy.net>`` in code under ``~/hobby`` - and set this
        rule once, in ``~/.hgrc``.
        
        .. contents::
           :local:
           :depth: 2
        
        .. sectnum::
        
        Example
        =====================
        
        Install the extension as described below.
        
        Write in your ``~/.hgrc``::
        
            [extensions]
            mercurial_dynamic_username =
        
            [dynamic_username]
            work.location = ~/work
            work.username = John Smith <john.smith@serious.com>
            hobby.location = ~/hobby ~/blogging
            hobby.username = Johny <fastjohny@fantasy.net>
        
        and just commit. In any repository placed below ``~/work`` you will commit as
        ``John Smith``, in repos below ``~/hobby`` as ``Johny``, elsewhere default
        setting (``username`` from ``[ui]``) will be used.
        
        Configuration syntax
        =====================
        
        All settings are defined in ``[dynamic_username]`` section, and have
        the following form::
        
            «somelabel».location = «list of directory names»
            «somelabel».username = «username used there»
        
        Labels are used only to join pairs of those settings together.
        
        Directory names specified in ``.location`` are space or colon
        separated, and can be quoted. Repository matches the rule if it
        belongs to the directory tree(s) specified here. Tildas (``~/..`` and
        ``~john/...``) are properly expanded.
        
        Usernames have the same syntax as standard ``username``.
        
        Defining ``.location`` without paired ``.username`` asks extension to
        revert to standard username, for example::
        
            [ui]
            username = Jake <jake@loose.net>
        
            [dynamic_username]
            work.location = ~/work
            work.username = John Smith <john.smith@serious.com>
            open.location = ~/work/open-source
        
        will commit as ``John Smith`` in ``~/work/libs/veryimportant``, but
        will revert to default ``Jake`` in ``~/work/open-source/libshared``.
        
        Match priority
        ==================================================
        
        If more than one location matches repository, longest one is used
        (like in the ``open-source`` example above). *Longest* is selected
        using actual canonical path after tilda expansion (``~/work/sth`` is
        longer than ``/home/littlejohny/work``).
        
        Dynamic usernames currently always win against ``[ui]``-section
        ``username``, even if the latter is defined in per-repository
        ``.hg/hgrc``. I would gladly give priority to the latter, but I have
        no idea how to detect that without re-parsing the configuration.
        
        Testing configuration
        ==================================================
        
        You can test your configuration by callling::
        
            hg showconfig ui.username
        
        (results should vary depending on the current working directory).
        Handy way to compare::
        
            hg --cwd ~/work/libs/acme  showconfig ui.username
            hg --cwd ~/hobby/blogging  showconfig ui.username
        
        Installation
        =================================================
        
        Linux/Unix (from PyPI)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you have working ``pip`` or ``easy_install``::
        
            pip install --user mercurial_dynamic_username
        
        or maybe::
        
            sudo pip install mercurial_dynamic_username
        
        (or use ``easy_install`` instead of ``pip``). Then activate by::
        
            [extensions]
            mercurial_dynamic_username =
        
        To upgrade, repeat the same command with ``--upgrade`` option, for
        example::
        
            pip install --user --upgrade mercurial_dynamic_username
        
        Linux/Unix (from source)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you don't have ``pip``, or wish to follow development more closely:
        
        - clone both this repository and `mercurial_extension_utils`_ and put
          them in the same directory, for example::
        
            cd ~/sources
            hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-extension_utils/
            hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-dynamic_username/
        
        - update to newest tags,
        
        - activate by::
        
            [extensions]
            mercurial_dynamic_username = ~/sources/mercurial-dynamic_username/mercurial_dynamic_username.py
        
        To upgrade, pull and update.
        
        Note that directory names matter. See `mercurial_extension_utils`_ for
        longer description of this kind of installation.
        
        Windows
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you have any Python installed, you may install with ``pip``::
        
            pip install mercurial_dynamic_username
        
        Still, as Mercurial (whether taken from TortoiseHg_, or own package)
        uses it's own bundled Python, you must activate by specifying the path::
        
            [extensions]
            mercurial_dynamic_username = C:/Python27/Lib/site-packages/mercurial_dynamic_username.py
            ;; Or wherever pip installed it
        
        To upgrade to new version::
        
            pip --upgrade mercurial_dynamic_username
        
        If you don't have any Python, clone repositories::
        
            cd c:\hgplugins
            hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-extension_utils/
            hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-dynamic_username/
        
        update to tagged versions and activate by path::
        
            [extensions]
            mercurial_dynamic_username = C:/hgplugins/mercurial-dynamic_username/mercurial_dynamic_username.py
            ;; Or wherever you cloned
        
        See `mercurial_extension_utils`_ documentation for more details on
        Windows installation. 
        
        .. note::
        
           Directory names matter. If ``mercurial_dynamic_username.py`` can't find
           ``mercurial_extension_utils.py`` in system path, it looks for it in
           its own directory, in ``../mercurial_extension_utils``, and in
           ``../extension_utils``.
