Description: # RGBmon
        
        RGBmon is a system monitoring tool that lights up your components to indicate system status.
        
        **Note:** This is really early stage. Expect the project and configuration to change a lot.
        You should only use modes on devices that can handle frequent color updates. If the device supports such updates they are often refered to as *direct* mode.
