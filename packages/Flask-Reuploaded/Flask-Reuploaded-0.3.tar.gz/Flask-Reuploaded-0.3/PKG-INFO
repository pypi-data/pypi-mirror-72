Description: Flask-Reuploaded
        ================
        
        Flask-Reuploaded provides file uploads for Flask.
        
        
        Notes on this package
        ---------------------
        
        This is an independently maintained version of `Flask-Uploads` based
        on the 0.2.1 version of the original, but also including four years of
        unreleased changes - at least not released to PyPi.
        
        Noteworthy is the fix for the `Werkzeug` API change.
        
        
        Goals
        -----
        
        - `Flask-Reuploaded` is a stable drop-in replacement for `Flask-Uploads`
        - regain momentum for this widely used package
        - provide working PyPi packages

        Installation
        ------------
        
        There is no released version on PyPi yet.
        
        As the original `Flask-Uploads` is broken since months, this is a top priority.
