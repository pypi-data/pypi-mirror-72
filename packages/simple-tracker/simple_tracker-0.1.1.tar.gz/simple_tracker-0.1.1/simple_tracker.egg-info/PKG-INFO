        Track multiple objects using just x, y coordinates!
        
        simple_tracker is lightweight, platform independent, and requires no external dependencies other than the Python standard library. It is originally designed to count and track objects on [OpenMV](https://openmv.io/) MicroPython boards and will see future use with opencv-python on Raspberry Pi.

        from simple_tracker import Tracker
        
        tracker = Tracker()
        while True:

            tracker.update(centroids)
        ```
