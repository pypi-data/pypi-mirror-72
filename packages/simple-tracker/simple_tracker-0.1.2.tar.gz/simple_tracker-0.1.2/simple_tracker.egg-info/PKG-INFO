        Track multiple objects using just x, y coordinates!
        
        simple_tracker is a simple cemtrpod object tracker and requires no external dependencies other than the Python standard library. It is originally designed to count and track objects on [OpenMV](https://openmv.io/) MicroPython boards and will see future use with opencv-python on Raspberry Pi.
        
        ## In action
        
        This was made using an OpenMV cam and the example [here](examples/openmv/simple_tracking.py)

        ## Installation
        ```bash

        or
        ```bash
        $ pip install simple-tracker
        ```
        ## Usage
        All you need to do is pass a list of tuples (x, y) to the Tracker.update() method
        ```python
        from simple_tracker import Tracker
        
        tracker = Tracker()
        while True:
            centroids = some_detection_algorithm()
            tracker.update(centroids)
        ```
