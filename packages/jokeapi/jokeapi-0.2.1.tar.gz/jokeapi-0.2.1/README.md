An API wrapper for Sv443's joke api which provides simple yet versatile functionality,
while also maintaining a readable codebase.

## Install

You can install jokeapi through [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) by using `pip install jokeapi`

So far there are no build from source instructions.

---

# get_joke

The wrapper is structured in such a way that the end-user should only ever have to
interact with one function. This function is `get_joke()`

---

## get_joke

### Example

```python
  from jokeapi import Jokes # Import the Jokes class

  j = Jokes()  # Initialise the class
  j.get_joke()  # Retrieve a random joke
```

### Parameters

---

#### category

A list of categories that the returned joke should fit in.
Options are:
`programming`,
`miscellaneous`,
`dark`

If left blank it will default to use `Any`.

##### Example

```python
  joke = get_joke(categories=['programming', 'dark'])  # Will return a joke that fits in either the programming or dark category.
```

---

#### blacklist

A list of properties that the joke *shouldn't* have.
Options are:
`nsfw`,
`religious`,
`political`,
`racist`,
`sexist`

If left blank it will default to `None`.

##### Example

```python
  joke = get_joke(blacklist=['nsfw', 'racist'])  # Will return a joke that does not have either the flag "nsfw" or "racist".
```

---

#### response_format

The format in which the API should respond.
Options are:
`json`,
`yaml`,
`xml`,
`txt`

If left blank it will default to `json`.

#### Example

```python
  joke = get_joke(response_format="xml")  # Will return a joke in xml format.
```

---

### type

The type of joke returned.
Options are:
`single`,
`twopart`

If left blank it will default to `Any`

#### Example

```python
  joke = get_joke(type="twopart")  # Will return a twopart joke; both a setup and a delivery.
```

---

### search_string

A string to search for in jokes.

If left blank it will default to `None`

#### Example

```python
  joke = get_joke(search_string="the")  # Will return a joke with the word "the" in it.
  # If there are no jokes then it will return the error from the API.
```

---

### id_range

The range in which the selected joke should fall. ID's are decided by the order in which jokes are submitted.
The argument passes should be in form of list or tuple, and should not exceed length of 2 items. First item
should be minimum 0.

If left blank it will default to the maximum range.


#### Example

```python
  joke = get_joke(id_range=[10,100])  # Will return a joke with the ID between 10 and 100
```

---
