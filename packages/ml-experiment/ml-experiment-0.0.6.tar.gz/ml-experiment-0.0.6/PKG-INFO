Description: ## Introduction
        
        This Python package facilitates the fast prototyping of
        machine learning model with great scalability and flexibility.
        
        Characteristics of this package:
        
        * Flexibility of Feature Engineering: it is convenient to define a function to 
        put to feature-processing pipeline;
        * Flexibility of Models: there is no restriction about whether you have to use
        scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch;
        * Few Specifications on Models: user only need to worry about the `fit`
        and `predict_proba`;
        * Training Job Specifications: features, data locations, model specifications can
        be specified in a Python dictionary or JSON, facilitating potential
        MapReduce or parallelism;
        * Scalability: data is stored temporarily in disks in batch
        to save memory space;
        * Statistics: statistical measures of the performance of the models and
        their class labels are calculated;
        * Cross Validation: cross validation option is available.
        * Ready Adaptation to Production: data pipelines and algorithms can be adapted into
        production codes with little changes.
        
        There will be tutorials and documentations.
