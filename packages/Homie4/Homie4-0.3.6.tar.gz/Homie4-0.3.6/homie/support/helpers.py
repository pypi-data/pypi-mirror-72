Topic IDs

An MQTT topic consists of one or more topic levels, separated by the slash character (/). A topic level ID MAY contain lowercase letters from a to z, numbers from 0 to 9 as well as the hyphen character (-).
A topic level ID MUST NOT start or end with a hyphen (-). The special character $ is used and reserved for Homie attributes. The underscore (_) is used and reserved for Homie node arrays.
