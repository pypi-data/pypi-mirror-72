Description: # pgp-utils
        This is a very simple command utility that just wraps up some common operations with pgp keys/a yubikey.
        
        For example, you can sign, encrypt, decrypt, switch yubikey (and more) with short and simple commands.
        
        ## Configuration
        The utility expects a small config file located at `$PGP_UTIL_HOME/config.json`. `$PGP_UTIL_HOME` defaults to `~/.config/pgp-utils`.
        The format of the file is:
        `
        {
            "key_id": <YOUR_KEY_ID>
        }
        `
        
        ## Usage
        - `pgp-utils --help`: Display help, available commands etc.
        - `pgp-utils switch`: Switch yubikey to the one currently inserted into a USB port on your device.
        - `pgp-utils encrypt FILE ...RECIPIENTS`:
        - `pgp-utils decrypt FILE`:
        - `ppg-utils sign FILE`:
