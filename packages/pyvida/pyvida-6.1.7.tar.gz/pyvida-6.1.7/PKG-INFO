        ### Writing a game in pyvida ###
        
        Please refer to the documentation in pyvida/docs
        
        #### Empty Project ####
        
        ```
            app = Game(name="basic project", fullscreen=False)
            app.init()  # initialise sound and graphics
            app.run()  # start the event loop
        ```
        
        #### Game with one scene ####
        ```
            app = Game(name="basic project", fullscreen=False)
        
            scene = Scene("main interface")
            app.add(scene)
            app.camera.scene(scene)  # set the camera to the scene
        
            app.init()  # initialise sound and graphics
            app.run()  # start the event loop
        ```
        
        
        ### Developer ###
        
        You can contribute to pyvida by cloning the github repository.
        
        To make a scripting event, on your class add a:
        
        def on_<event>(self) method.
            self.busy += 1 # to make the event block the next event for that actor
            self.game._waiting = True  # to make the event block all other events in the game.
        
        
        
        ### Tests ###
        pip3 install pytest pytest-mock
        
        Run the tests:
        python3 tests.py
