Description: # github-releaser
        
        `github-releaser` is a command-line tool for creating releases on GitHub.
        
        ## Installation
        
        `pipenv install github-releaser`
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Creating a release
        
        To create a release, use the command `create-release`, e.g.:
        ```shell script
        github-releaser create-release --account myuser --repository myrepo --tag-name v1.0.10
        ```
        
        The example above will create a new release with a name and tag set to `v1.0.10` at `myuser/myrepo`. The option 
        `--release-name` is optional, and if not specified the release name will be the same as the value of the `--tag-name`, in 
        this case: `v1.0.10`
        
        To see all the options use: `github-releaser create-release --help`
        
        ### Uploading assets
        
        The command `upload-assets` to add assets to a release. Note that to upload assets a release must have been previously
        created.
        
        Give that there is already a release `v1.0.10` at `myuser/myrepo`, it is possible to add assets with the following command:
        ```shell script
        github-releaser upload-assets --account myuser --repository myrepo --tagname v1.0.10 assets/*.zip
        ```
        
        The example above uploads all `.zip` files from the `assets` directory to a release `v1.0.10` at `myuser/myrepo`.
        
        To see all the options use: `github-releaser upload-assets --help`
