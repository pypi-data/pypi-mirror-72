COPYRIGHTED LICENSE

Until this project is finished and merged to the upstream (eta 15/04/2018) I decided to put closed license on this project.
It means the project codes / new own implemented ideas and protocols cannot be used anywhere.

If you like the project and you would like to use it now, drop me a line at
ph4r05 AT gmail DOT com or create an issue in the repository. Thanks for understanding.

After the project is merged I will update license to MIT.
