Description: # CCorp Ruamel.YAML Include Extension
        
        This package is exactly ccorp-yaml-include package(a fork of ccorp-yaml-include) that contains a bug fix (init of YAML didn't accept a 'typ' kwargs that was a list)
        It also allows to use `!include` tag with a relative path for aliases, e.g.
        instead of just writing:
        - !include bear_common.yaml (which means that bear_common.yaml should be located in the same directory as your yaml file)
        you can have:
        - !include ../common_data/bear_common.yaml (which means that bear_common.yaml in now located in a separate folder 'common_data')
