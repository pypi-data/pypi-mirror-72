And I find it frustrating.\n\nEnough rambling. Here\'s what you came for.\n\nNote down your ideas and get them to the right place, without switching away from your terminal\n\n## Installation\n\nIdeaseed is available [on PyPI.org](https://pypi.org/project/ideaseed):\n\n```sh-session\npip install ideaseed\n```\n\nSee [Installation troubleshooting](#installation-troubleshooting) if you can\'t install it like this.\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\nideaseed (--help | --about | --version)\nideaseed [options] ARGUMENTS...\n```\n\n### Examples\n\n```sh-session\n# Save a card "test" in schoolsyst/webapp > project "UX" > column "To-Do"\n$ ideaseed schoolsyst/webapp UX "test"\n# Save a card "lorem" in your-username/ipsum > project "ipsum" > column "To-Do"\n$ ideaseed ipsum "lorem"\n# Save a card "a CLI to note down ideas named ideaseed" in your user profile > project "incubator" > column "willmake"\n$ ideaseed --user-keyword=project --user-project=incubator project "a CLI to note down ideas named ideaseed"\n```\n\n### Arguments\n\n| Argument | Meaning                                                                                                              | Default value  |\n| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |\n| REPO     | Select a repository by name                                                                                          |\n|          | If not given, uses Google Keep instead of GitHub (or uses your user profile\'s projects if --project is used)         |\n|          | If --user-keyword\'s value is given, creates a card on your user\'s project (select which project with --user-project) |\n|          | If given in the form OWNER/REPO, uses the repository OWNER/REPO                                                      |\n|          | If given in the form REPO, uses the repository "your username/REPO"                                                  |\n| PROJECT  | Select a project by name to put your card to [default: REPO\'s value]                                                 | `REPO`\'s value |\n|          | If creating a card on your user\'s project, this becomes the COLUMN                                                   |\n| COLUMN   | Select a project\'s column by name [default: To-Do]                                                                   | To-Do          |\n|          | If creating a card on your user\'s project, this is ignored                                                           |\n\n### Options\n\n| Shorthand | Full-length            | Description                                                                                                     |\n| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| -c        | --color COLOR          | Chooses which color to use for Google Keep cards.

You don\'t need to remember those options\n\nYou can also use `ideaseed -I` to prompt you for some information:\n\n- Where do you want to upload this idea? (github, google keep)\n- If you decide to use github,\n  - On your profile?\n  - If not:\n    - Which repo? (using REPO or OWNER/REPO) (autocompletes with repositories you contribute to)\n    - Which column? (choices are the column names, and you can type the column\'s index to be quicker)\n- If you decide to use google keep,\n  - Which color? (defaults to white)\n  - Some tags?\n\n## Installation troubleshooting\n\nIf you get an error message saying "No matching distribution found":\n\n```sh-session\n$ pip install ideaseed\nCollecting ideaseed\n  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement ideaseed (from versions: )\nNo matching distribution found for ideaseed\n```\n\nSee if the python version `pip` uses is at least 3.6:\n\n```sh-session\n$ pip --version\npip 9.0.1 from /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7) # Should be at least "(python 3.6)"\n```\n\nYou can then try with `pip3` (`pip3 --version` should report a python version of at least 3.6):\n\n```sh-session\n$ pip3 --version\npip 20.0.2 from /home/ewen/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)\n$ pip3 install ideaseed\n```\n',
