.SH NAME
amdgpu-monitor \- continuously update a table with the state of all compatible AMD GPUs

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B amdgpu-monitor
.RB [ \-\-help " | " \-\-about "]"
.br
.B amdgpu-monitor
.RB [ \-\-gui "] [" \-\-no_fan "] [" \-\-plot "] [" \-\-ltz "] [" \-\-sleep " \fIN\fP] [" \-\-debug "] [" \-\-pdebug "]

.SH CONFIGURATION
All amdgpu-utils require that compatible GPU cards and drivers are installed and that
the feature to access them is enabled.  This can be accomplished by adding
amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xfffd7fff to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT value in
/etc/default/grub and executing update-grub.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B amdgpu-monitor
will continuously display the current state of all compatible AMD GPUs. The default
behavior is to update a text based table in the current window until Ctrl-C is pressed.
Command line options can alter this behaviour allowing the use of GUI, modifying update
interval, excluding fans, writing to a log, selecting UTC or local time zone, and
engaging a graphical display of real-time trends of relevant parameters.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR " \-\-about"
Will display details about 
.B amdgpu-monitor\fP.
.TP
.BR " \-\-gui"
The table of relevant parameters will be updated in a Gtk window instead of a text table in the terminal window.
.TP
.BR " \-\-log"
Write all monitor data to a logfile.  The real-time display will indicate that logging
is enabled and will show the filename used.
.TP
.BR " \-\-ltz"
Use local time zone instead of UTC for displays and logging.
.TP
.BR " \-\-no_fan"
Will exclude fan information from the display.  Useful with water cooled GPUs.
.TP
.BR " \-\-pdebug"
Will enable debug output for the \fBamdgpu-plot\fR plotting utility.
.TP
.BR " \-\-plot"
Open and write to, \fBamdgpu-plot\fR, the amdgpu-util plotting utility.
.TP
.BR " \-\-sleep " \fIN\fR
Specifies N, the number of seconds to sleep between updates.
.TP
.BR " \-\-debug"
Will display additional details useful in troubleshooting.
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"
Display help text and exit.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.nf
.B amdgpu-monitor \-\-sleep 5 \-\-log

.fi
Will display a continuously updating table of GPU operating parameters updating with an interval of 5 sec. All
parameters will be written to a logfile which will be indicated in the table.
The displayed parameters include GPU model, load percentage, power, power cap, energy consumption, temperature,
voltage, fan speed, Sclk frequency/p-state, Mclk frequency/pstate, and performance mode.
Updating of the table will continue until ctrl-c is pressed.
.P
.B amdgpu-monitor \-\-gui

.fi
Will open a new Gtk window and display basic parameters updated with the default interval.
.P
.B amdgpu-monitor \-\-plot

.fi
Will open 2 new Gtk windows. One will display the basic parameters and the second will display a continuously
updating plot of these parameters.  It is suggested that this method be used if both displays are desired, instead
of executing both \fBamdgpu-monitor\fR and \fBamdgpu-plot\fR as the later will result in twice the reads of
GPU data.
.P

.SH "FILES"
.PP
.TP
\fB/usr/share/misc/pci.ids\fR
The system list of all known AMD PCI ID's (vendors, devices, classes and subclasses).
It can be updated with the \fBupdate-pciids\fR command.
.TP
\fB~/.amdgpu-utils/amd_pci_id.txt\fR
A locally updated list of all known AMD PCI ID's (vendors, devices, classes and subclasses).
It is preferred to use the system PCI ID file.  If this the local file exists, it will be used instead of
the system file and can be removed with \fBamdgpu-pciid \-\-remove_local\fR command.
.TP
\fB/sys/class/drm/card*/device/pp_od_clk_voltage\fR
Special driver file for each GPU required for \fBamdgpu-utils\fR.
.TP
\fB/etc/default/grub\fR
The grub defaults file where amdgpu.ppfeaturemask needs to be set.

.SH BUGS
Known to not work well with Fiji ProDuo cards and will issue warning messages for Fiji Nano cards.
