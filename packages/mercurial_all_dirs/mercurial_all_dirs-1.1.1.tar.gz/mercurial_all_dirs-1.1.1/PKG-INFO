        ====================================
        Mercurial All Dirs extension
        ====================================
        
        Execute the same Mercurial command in many repositories.
        
        .. contents::
           :local:
           :depth: 2
        
        .. sectnum::
        
        Example
        =====================
        
        Imagine you have Mercurial repositories in ``~/src/libs/acme``, 
        ``~/src/libs/net/aaa``, and ``~/src/libs/net/bbb``. Then::
        
            cd ~/src/libs
            hg alldirs status
            # … shows status in all three repos
            hg alldirs heads -t
            # … and heads
            hg alldirs log -l 2
            # … and recent commit
        
        and even::
        
            hg alldirs commit -m "Documentation updates"
            # Commit in all three repos
            hg alldirs push bb
            # … and pushes them all
        
        Relative file names are resolved against given repo root (the
        command chdirs to every repo before actually executing it)::
        
            hg alldirs commit -m "Version update" setup.py src/version.py 
        
        .. note::
        
           In practice I usually shortcut the command and type::
        
                hg alld status
                # etc
        
        Note that ``alldirs`` does not require any kind of *parent
        repository*.
        
        In case you are already inside some repo, command is executed on
        it, so ``alld`` does not matter::
        
            cd ~/src/libs/net/aaa
            hg status
            hg alld status
            # … Both do the same
        
        
        Failure handling
        =================================================
        
        In case given command is not known (``hg alldirs badcommand``), or
        got invalid options (``hg alldirs log -s``), error is reported
        immediately and processing stops.
        
        .. note::
        
           Technically: command name and params are parsed once, before
           visiting subdirs.
        
        In case given commands fails during execution (``hg alldirs pull
        nosuchalias``), ``alldirs`` executes the command in every repo
        (doesn't stop). After finishing the job, it summarizes list of
        repositories in which the command failed.
        
        .. note::
        
           That is done on purpose, I do not want my ``hg alld pull``
           to break if some repo lacks default path.
        
        In both cases whole command returns exit status signalling
        an error. 
        
        
        Installation
        =================================================
        
        Linux/Unix (from PyPI)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you have working ``pip`` or ``easy_install``::
        
            pip install --user mercurial_all_dirs
        
        or maybe::
        
            sudo pip install mercurial_all_dirs
        
        (or use ``easy_install`` instead of ``pip``). Then activate by::
        
            [extensions]
            mercurial_all_dirs =
        
        To upgrade, repeat the same command with ``--upgrade`` option, for
        example::
        
            pip install --user --upgrade mercurial_all_dirs
        
        Linux/Unix (from source)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you don't have ``pip``, or wish to follow development more closely:
        
        - clone both this repository and `mercurial_extension_utils`_ and put
          them in the same directory, for example::
        
            cd ~/sources
            hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-extension_utils/
            hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-all_dirs/
        
        - update to newest tags,
        
        - activate by::
        
            [extensions]
            mercurial_all_dirs = ~/sources/mercurial-all_dirs/mercurial_all_dirs.py
        
        To upgrade, pull and update.
        
        See `mercurial_extension_utils`_ for longer description of this kind
        of installation.
        
        Windows
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you have any Python installed, you may install with ``pip``::
        
            pip install mercurial_all_dirs
        
        Still, as Mercurial (whether taken from TortoiseHg_, or own package)
        uses it's own bundled Python, you must activate by specifying the path::
        
            [extensions]
            mercurial_all_dirs = C:/Python27/Lib/site-packages/mercurial_all_dirs.py
            ;; Or wherever pip installed it
        
        To upgrade to new version::
        
            pip --upgrade mercurial_all_dirs
        
        If you don't have any Python, clone repositories::
        
            cd c:\hgplugins
            hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-extension_utils/
            hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-all_dirs/
        
        update to tagged versions and activate by path::
        
            [extensions]
            mercurial_all_dirs = C:/hgplugins/mercurial-all_dirs/mercurial_all_dirs.py
            ;; Or wherever you cloned
        
        See `mercurial_extension_utils`_ documentation for more details on
        Windows installation. 
        
        
        
        Related extensions
        ==================================================
        
        There are a few extensions which support operations on repository
        groups - `Subrepos Extension`_, `OnSub Extension`_, `Forest
        Extension`_. They all require using parent repository, which defines
        the project structure. So, to pull all repos below ``~/src`` you
        must ``hg init src``, create file like ``.hgsub`` there, etc.
        
        All Dirs does not require such a parent repo. It just works on
        whatever is found on the disk. You decided to keep some repositories
        below ``~/src``? Fine, you can ``hg alld status`` them all.
        
        Command syntax also matters. I strongly prefer typing::
        
             hg alld pull --update
        
        to typing::
        
             hg onsub "hg pull --update"
        
        At the same time, All Dirs does not support any kind of declaration
        that some repositories are related, group cloning, version
        relationship etc. If you are interested in such features, consider
        `Subrepos Extension`_.
