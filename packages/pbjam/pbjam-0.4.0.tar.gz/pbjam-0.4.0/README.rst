PBjam is toolbox for modeling the oscillation spectra of solar-like oscillators. This involves two main parts: identifying a set of modes of interest, and accurately modeling those modes to measure their frequencies.

Currently, the mode identification is based on fitting the asymptotic relation to the l=2,0 pairs, relying on the cumulative sum of prior knowledge gained from NASA's Kepler mission to inform the fitting process.

Modeling the modes, or 'peakbagging', is done using the HMC sampler from `pymc3 <https://docs.pymc.io/>`_, which fits a Lorentzian to each of the identified modes, with much fewer priors than during he mode ID process. This allows for a more accurate model of the spectrum of frequencies, than the heavily parameterized models like the asymptotic relation.
