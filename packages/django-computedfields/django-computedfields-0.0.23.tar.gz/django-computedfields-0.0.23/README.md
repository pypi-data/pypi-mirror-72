### django-computedfields ###

django-computedfields provides autoupdated database fields
for model methods.

Tested with Django 2.2 and 3.0 (Python 3.6 to 3.8).


#### Example ####

Just derive your model from `ComputedFieldsModel` and place
the `@computed` decorator at a method:

```python
from django.db import models
from computedfields.models import ComputedFieldsModel, computed

class MyModel(ComputedFieldsModel):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=32)

    @computed(models.CharField(max_length=32), depends=[['self', ['name']]])
    def computed_field(self):
        return self.name.upper()
```

`computed_field` will be turned into a real database field
and can be accessed and searched like any other database field.
During saving the associated method gets called and itâ€™s result
written to the database. With the method `compute('fieldname')`
you can inspect the value that will be written, which is useful
if you have pending changes:

```python
>>> person = MyModel(forename='berty')
>>> person.computed_field             # empty since not saved yet
>>> person.compute('computed_field')  # outputs 'BERTY'
>>> person.save()
>>> person.computed_field             # outputs 'BERTY'
```

The  `depends` keyword argument can be used with any relation to indicate dependencies to fields on other models as well:

```python
from django.db import models
from computedfields.models import ComputedFieldsModel, computed

class MyModel(ComputedFieldsModel):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=32)
    fk = models.ForeignKey(SomeModel)

    @computed(models.CharField(max_length=32), depends=[['self', ['name']], ['fk', ['fieldname']]])
    def computed_field(self):
        return self.name.upper() + self.fk.fieldname
```

Now changes to `self.name` or `fk.fieldname` will update `computed_field`.

**NOTE:** The old depends syntax is deprecated and should be replaced with the new syntax.
It also should contain a `self` entry with local fields to get reliable updates from local field changes.
This is especially true for advanced usage with `save(update_fields=[...])` or bulk actions.
The old syntax will be removed with a future version.
