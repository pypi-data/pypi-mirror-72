Description: # distributions_bc package
        
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        Python 3.7.4+
        matplotlib package
        
        
        ### Files
        
        Contains 3 files:
        
        * generaldistribution.py
        * binomialdistribution.py
        * gaussiandistribution.py
        
        
        
        * generaldistribution.py contains a Distribution class
        * binomialdistribution.py creates a Binomial class that inherits from the Distribution class. This Binomial class has attributes typically associated with a Binomial Distribution (n, p, k, mean, stdev etc.) that can be either specified or determined from a file read in. The Binomial class also has methods that allow the computation of the probability distribution function and its plotting. A magic method that allows the addition of 2 Binomial Objects with the same p is also present
        
        
        * gaussiandistribution.py creates a Gaussian class that inherits from the Distribution class. This Gaussian class has attributes typically associated with a Gaussian Distribution (mean, stdev) that can be either specified or determined from a file read in. The Binomial class also has methods that allow the computation of the probability distribution function and its the plotting. A magic method that allows the addition of 2 Gaussian Objects is also present
        
        
        ### Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install distributions-bc
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        
        ```bash
        from distributions_bc import Gaussian
        
        g1 = Gaussian(mu = 23, sigma = 2)
        g1.mean # 23
        g1.stdev # 2
        g1.pdf(x = 22) # 0.2787008074875851
        
        
        g1.read_data_file('numbers.txt')  # Reads file and updates attributes and parameters
        ```
