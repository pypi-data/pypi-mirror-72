# ptcn

Tensorflow (2.x) implementation of a Temporal Convolutional Network architecture, with a probabilistic twist.

This project indulges a couple of curiosities:

1. Working with convolutional sequence-to-sequence models a la [An Empirical Evaluation of Generic Convolutional and Recurrent Networks for Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01271)
2. Adding a bayesian twist to the network a la [Bayesian Segnet: Model Uncertainty in Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architectures for Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02680)

This implementation has been inspired by other projects, including:
